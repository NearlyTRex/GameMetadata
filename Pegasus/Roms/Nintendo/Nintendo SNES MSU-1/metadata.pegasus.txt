  It's MEGA MAN versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis -
  that strange multi-layered land of robot-like humanoids created by the wrongly-
  performed experiments with human beings by Dr. Wily. Mega Man - the chosen
  defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate
  Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange
  misrepresentations of humans.
  .
  Mega Man's goal is monumental. He must infiltrate seven separate heavily-guarded
  empires. By himself, he must break down and destroy the following empire
  leaders: Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman, and Dr. Wily. The
  action involves Mega Man armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering
  strangely-configured humanoids. They're atop, in and out of fortified prison-
  like structures strengthened with thick walls. Hidden amid gun turrets embedded
  in concrete uprights, even in subterranean passages below icefields. WOW!

  It's you against the evil Mother Brain in the thrilling battle of Metroid!
  .
  You're inside the fortress planet Zebes.  The planet of endless secret
  passageways where the Metroid are multiplying.  Left alone the Metroid are
  harmless.  But in the wrong hands they could destroy the galaxy.  It's up to you
  to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil
  purposes.  But that won't be easy.  You'll have to use your spacesuit to absorb
  valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice
  Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia.  If you survive, it will be you and
  your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.
  .
  Worth Noting:
  .
  Metroid introduced nonlinear, side-scroller, maze-like, gameplay, in a platform,
  shooter. Metroid required players to discover permanent power-ups to progress
  further along; while backtracking through previously visited areas. The style is
  affectionately known as Metroid-vania' (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night being
  the second half to the term, mirrored the concept).
  .
  Completing the game in time and with enough power-ups revealed different
  endings. At the end Samus removes the helmet or power suit (depending) to a
  reveal a shocking suprise that endeared the character and broke new ground in
  gaming.
