publisher: Aksys Games
genre: Action;Rhythm;Music
description:
  Bit.Trip Fate takes place over three environments, each divided into two stages
  and culminating in a boss encounter. The first environment (stages Determination
  and Patience) resembles a crystal cavern over a space backdrop, the second
  (stages Desperation and Frustration) a cityscape filled with skyscrapers, and
  the third (stages Anger and Fall) an underground pit with rivers of magma.
  .
  The game's hybrid mechanics feature a side perspective, resembling a horizontal
  shooter, but with Commander Video confined to a set path, called the Vibe (along
  which he can freely move forward and backward), an element of rail shooters. In
  addition, the player controls Commander Video's movement independently of his
  targeting reticule, similar to the style of twin-stick games descended from
  Robotron: 2084. The reticule is commanded by the Wii Remote's IR pointer, with
  bullets firing radially from Commander Video's location. Movement along the rail
  is faster while the player is not holding down the trigger button. The rail
  takes on various shapes, usually similar to a sine wave, which are predetermined
  by the stage, while the screen scrolls at a steady rate. Enemies advance from
  all directions, firing targeted and patterned bullets tradition to shoot 'em
  ups.
  .
  The player's performance and interaction with enemies creates musical feedback
  which contributes to the stage's soundtrack, providing an element similar to
  certain music games, particularly Rez. The gameplay is less rhythmically
  constrained than previous entries in the series, providing more freedom to the
  player, but also less dynamic feedback.

description:
  The player takes on the role of the eponymous Jett Rocket, a planetary inspector
  who is tasked with stopping the Power Plant Posse (PPP) from polluting the
  Earth-like planet Yoroppa. The objective is to clear each stage within the
  planet's three areas: the lush and tropical Atoll, the glacial and snowy
  Northpole, and the toxic and jungle-like Swamps. Within each stage lies a set
  number of solar cells, many of which are scattered about and some of which are
  hidden, that Jett must collect in order to unlock each stage and gain access to
  the subsequent areas. Additionally, Jett must defeat a general of the PPP at the
  end of each area. As with standard platforming games, Jett is capable of
  jumping, but can briefly hover when using his jet pack.[4] Within certain
  stages, he can also paraglide as well as either ride a hoverboard or a jetboat.
  In addition, Jett can defeat enemies, clear obstacles and activate switches with
  his "Dash" attack, which can be executed by shaking the Wii Remote while he is
  standing (which sees him perform a somersaulting tackle) or after a jump (which
  sees him perform a diving hammer fist). The game also features an achievement
  system that can be completed either during or after completion of the main
  story.
