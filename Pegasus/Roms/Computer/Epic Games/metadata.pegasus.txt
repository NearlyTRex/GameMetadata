description:
  The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian
  Entertainment and Private Division. Lost in transit while on a colonist ship
  bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find
  yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon
  colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various
  factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine
  how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony,
  you are the unplanned variable.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  * The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you
  approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the
  story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game
  scenarios.
  .
  * You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of
  flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While
  playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you
  aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the
  Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but
