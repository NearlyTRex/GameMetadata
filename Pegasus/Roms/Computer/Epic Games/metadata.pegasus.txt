  You can report the suspicious activities of a father but orphan his children. Or
  you can withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance
  to make things right? Or you can blackmail him to earn something your family.

  The Callisto Protocol
  .
  In this narrative-driven, third-person survival horror game set 300 years in the
  future, the player will take on the role of Jacob Lee - a victim of fate thrown
  into Black Iron Prison, a maximum-security penitentiary located on Jupiter's
  moon, Callisto. When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the
  prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to
  escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets
  buried beneath the surface of Callisto.
  .
  HORROR ENGINEERING

  The Callisto Protocol is a next-generation take on survival horror from the mind
  of Glen Schofield. Blending atmosphere, tension, and brutality with terrifying
  moments of helplessness and humanity, The Callisto Protocol immerses players in
  a pulse-pounding story where unspeakable horrors lurk around every corner.
  .
  UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNITED JUPITER COMPANY
  .
  Set on Jupiter's dead moon Callisto in the year 2320, The Callisto Protocol
  casts players as Jacob Lee, an inmate in Black Iron Prison. When a mysterious

  the bloodthirsty creatures that stalk him as he unravels the dark mysteries at
  the heart of the powerful United Jupiter Company.
  .
  MASTER BRUTAL, STRATEGIC COMBAT
  .
  The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-
  hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black
  Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up
  close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting
  off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive
  each life-or-death encounter.
  .
  EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON
  .
  One of the most hostile, isolated environments in the universe, Callisto looms
  large over Jacob's desperate struggle to survive. Players must not only contend

developer: Obsidian Entertainment
publisher: Private Division
genre: Role-Playing;Western-Style
description:
  The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian
  Entertainment and Private Division. Lost in transit while on a colonist ship
  bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find
  yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon
  colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various
  factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine
  how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony,
  you are the unplanned variable.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  * The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you
  approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the
  story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game
  scenarios.
  .
  * You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of
  flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While
  playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you
  aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the
  Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but
  rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional
  approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring
  Halcyon.
  .
  * Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you
  will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with
  unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and
  ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your
  own ends.
  .
  * Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy
  owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for
  the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony's two planets
  didn't exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and
  explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations
  throughout Halcyon.

  Your job is simple - get to the last escape pod and get out alive.
  .
  Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter's icy moon
  Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard
  your job is simple - get to the last escape pod and get out alive.
  .
  But you aren't the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals - a deranged
  custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more - can't wait to
  step over your corpse and save themselves.
  .
  Only one of you can make it off the moon - make sure it's you!
  .
  FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT
  .
  Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your
  loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle
  through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot
  to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment
  with your strategy, and get out!
  .
  ROUT YOUR RIVALS
  .
  You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a
  bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your
  correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make
  escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one
  duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make
  it out in one piece.
  .
  FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE
  .
  When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated
  corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison's dangers to earn a powerful
  experiment. But beware, it's not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard
  has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra
  tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy.
  .
  DO OR DIE
  .
  You've made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals,
  killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you're standing in front of
  that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of
  freedom... or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the
  prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons.
  But IF you succeed, you'll unlock new powerful permanent gear.

  FUTURE PUNK
