developer: Jutsu Games
publisher: Games Operators
genre: Indie;Simulation;Strategy
description:
  112 Operator allows you to manage emergency services in any city in the world!
  Dispatch units, take calls and face situations caused by weather, traffic or
  changing seasons. Help the city survive escalating events like riots, organized
  crime, terrorist attacks, cataclysms, natural disasters and many more!
  .
  Danger has escalated
  .
  Help on a scale bigger than ever before. The sequel of the award-winning 911
  Operator lets you act on many, completely different levels - from taking care of
  a single neighborhood to coordinating several operators' work in the world's
  biggest metropolises. Full 3D visualization will give you the inside view of
  your units' actions. Choose from over 100 000 areas, such as districts,
  municipalities, and tens of thousands of real cities from all over the world.
  .
  To all units: a storm is coming...
  .
  Face the dynamic weather, based on authentic, historical data. Watch the
  incidents change as day or night comes, traffic increases and seasons pass.
  Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural
  disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn't
  your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and
  gang wars.
  .
  112, what's your emergency?
  .
  Take calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services' help.
  You never know who's on the other side of the line - you might hear a
  frightening murder story, maybe you'll have to instruct someone on performing
  CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster.
  .
  It's my job, ma'am...
  .
  Choose one of the European cities in completely new Career mode and find out if
  you'll manage to climb up to the very top of an operator's career ladder. Follow
  the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you're in
  charge of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be
  followed by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they'll influence your own life.
  .
  You can also play special scenarios in any city in the world, or make your own
  rules in the Free Game mode.
  .
  We need backup!
  .
  Command the best specialists, using technologically advanced equipment and
  vehicles. Decide what to use - a SWAT team, Search and Rescue helicopter, or
  maybe riot gear? When your units arrive at the scene, command them in the
  tactical view that gives you the full image of the situation.
  .
  NEW FEATURES IN 112 OPERATOR:
  .
  25 times bigger, expandable maps of REAL CITIES with 3D buildings
  .
  entirely new set of emergency calls and large events
  .
  completely redesigned campaign mode, with objectives system, emails, and a story
  .
  day&night, weather, seasons and traffic now influences the duty and the
  incidents happening
  .
  new fire mechanic, that can consume entire areas and require dozens of units
  .
  region specification - gameplay will vary depending on a country legislation and
  district characteristics (slums / business / residential /industrial / forest
  etc)
  .
  new OnSite situation visualization that shows the action precisely and
  intuitively
  .
  new team members - doctors, sergeants, dogs, robots, and others!
  .

  to make things right? Or you can blackmail him to earn something your family.

  "El Hijo - A Wild West Tale" is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in
  which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother.
  .
  As a six-year-old, "El Hijo" must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As
  he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and,
  along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will
  lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert,
  and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.
  .
  A dangerous journey

  The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze
  their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded
  monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn't feel right and he plans his
  escape.

  Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as
  variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to
  increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product
  of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that "El Hijo" must traverse
  to reach his ultimate goal.

  Felix The Reaper is a challenging single-player puzzle game.
  .
  You take on the role as Felix, whose job is to make sure that people die. To do
  this, Felix must work in the shadows and rearrange faith so that death is always
  the end result.
  .
  At its core, the game is about manipulating shadows so that Felix can set up his
  targets safely covered by the shadows. The core gameplay has a Hitman Go'ish,
  Monument Valley'ing and Sokoban-like simplicity running through it.
  .
  There are three rules you have to master to become a successful Reaper:
  .
  Rule #1: Stick to the shadows
  .
  Each level is set on a grid-based platform. The squares of the grid are either
  lit up or in shadow, and Felix has to do his job in the shadows.
  .
  Rule #2: Control the shadows
  .
  Felix has the ability to rotate the sun, and move objects, to create new
  pathways for him to reach his target.
  .
  Rule #3: Make sure people die
  .
  The end goal of each level is to set up your targets and have them meet their
  maker.
  .
  To add something extra to this core game experience, we wrapped it in deep
  layers of storytelling, death, dance, art history, love and comedy. That way you
  get to enjoy a wholesome story world, while boiling your brains on complicatedly
  straight forward shadow puzzles about Death.

  RENOVATE
  .
  Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its
  former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint
  and decorate the place to your liking.
  .
  Just don't spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station
  after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can't be repaired and start serving
  your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.
  .
  EXPAND
  .
  You don't need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to
  serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You
  can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus
  attract more and more varied customers.
  .
  You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like
  providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like
  an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a
  few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon
  as well. There is so much you can do here.
  .
  CUSTOMIZE
  .
  Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The
  game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and
  lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place.

  Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It
  is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas
  station looks, the more customers will be attracted.
  .
  SERVE

  Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all
  expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren't
  that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to
  be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule
  various tasks for when it's less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the
  right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers
  happy.
  .
  HIRE
  .
  While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded
  and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just
  too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You
  can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas
  station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than
  others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better
  at them with time.
  .
  STOCK
  .
  You can't sell what you don't have. Keeping track of your stock is important and
  ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even
  better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to
  allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as
  deliveries take time and you really don't want to run out of goods to sell, not
  to mention fuel.
  .
  MANAGEMENT
  .
  We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management
  features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if
  micromanaging isn't your cup of tea, we don't force you to deal with the depths
  of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees
  can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.
  .
  KEY FEATURES

description:
  Whether you are drawn to the lands of Gloomhaven by the call of adventure or an
  avid desire for the glimmer of gold in the dark, your fate will surely be the
  same...
  .
  Lead your band of mercenaries through this unforgiving place, where every choice
  is crucial. Carve your way through terrifying dungeons, dreadful forests and
  dark caves filled with horrific monsters to reap your rewards... or die trying.
  .
  Sell your sword to anyone who can afford it, may they be city officials or
  corrupt cultists. You are paid to get results and not ask questions. Where will
  you draw the line?
  .
  Gloomhaven is a tactical RPG and a digital adaptation of the ultimate strategy
  board game by Isaac Childres (the highest-rated board game of all time on
  https://BoardGameGeek.com (Opens in new tab)). Set in a unique medieval dark
  fantasy universe, Gloomhaven rewards strategic planning and problem solving.
  Face this dark world alone or in online co-op for up to 4 players!
  .
  Explore the world in a band of 2 to 4 mercenaries. Each of the 17 unique
  characters comes with their own skills and more than 1,000 different abilities
  to master! Prepare your deck of ability cards before setting out to explore the
  dark caves and dreadful forest of Gloomhaven through quests and events.
  .
  Once inside a dungeon, engage in tactical turn-based combat by selecting two
  cards for each mercenary on every turn. You can only use the top half of one and
  the bottom half of another, so plan accordingly!
  .
  Move up your hired blades on the hex grid terrain to take advantage of the
  dungeon's environment. Set up deadly combos and unleash devastating powers but
  be wary of the cost. Cards are a resource as scarce and crucial as your life
  points, so watch out for exhaustion. Every choice has life or death
  consequences.
  .
  Hone your abilities during the game with enhancements and perks, while your
  power increases with level ups and new equipment. You need every advantage you
  can to survive here. So, gear up your band of mercenaries, chase powerful
  artifacts, buy the favor of the Great Oak, and never let your guard down.
  .
  Adapted from the original Gloomhaven Board Game, this branching campaign of 95
  story missions pits your greed against your morality. Many powerful opponents
  are vying for control over the city of Gloomhaven while others are looking for
  ancient crypts and forgotten artefacts. You could always side with the
  inhabitants, but it may not pay well...
  .
  Whatever your path may be, it will be paved with difficult choices.
  .
  Created in collaboration with the community during the early access, the
  Guildmaster adventure has more than 160 exclusive digital missions that allow
  you to experience another facet of Gloomhaven with new storylines, quests, map
  and NPCs.
  .
  Lead your guild of mercenaries in a region overrun by unspeakable things, far
  worse than simple bandits.
  .
  Choose the best combination of mercenaries for each fight and follow their
  character stories in this deadly new territory.

  communication networks have failed, governments have collapsed, and military
  forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe are now focused
  on self-preservation, the lucky few who survived having gone into hiding.
  .
  But not all have given up hope; a motley group of civilians, soldiers, and
  mercenaries have banded together to fight the outbreaks from privately funded
  bases across Europe. When a specimen clone outbreak is detected, the players are
  sent into Zed-laden hot zones to exterminate all threats using whatever means
  necessary. Welcome to the Killing Floor.

  Deck-builder roguelite inspired by the French Revolution and body horror
  .
  Liberte is a deck-builder roguelite set in Paris during the times of the French
  Revolution. Brave the war-torn streets as Rene - a regular Parisian entangled in
  a massive intrigue between the four most influential factions in the city.
  Collect cards, nurture alliances and discover the truth behind the city's
  cryptic invader from another dimension, Lady Bliss.
  .
  It's the middle of a history-defining moment for 18th-century Paris. Without the
  king, with the crown missing, you wake up in a world ravaged by Lady Bliss - an
  otherworldly being that appeared out of nowhere during the coronation of Prince
  Phillip. Lady Bliss wants you to find her a worthy queen or king. Why, out of
  all the people in Paris, a grey citizen like Rene is destined to find the next
  ruler?
  .
  Build your unique playstyle with cards & skins
  .
  Mix and match from over 100 Skills and Talents cards. Go full-on guns-blazing,
  cut your way out with blades and axes, hit your enemies with a guitar, and sing
  the revolutionary song! Lead Rene in his human form or use the skin-shifter
  ability to play as one of the characters - Master Hunter Victor, Tribal Warrior
  Flea, or Revolt Leader Ana. You'll encounter mighty enemies too, and face the
  curses of the Bliss, so make sure to come to the battlefield prepared.
  .
  Unravel the horrifying mystery of the Bliss
  .
  Lady Bliss came out of nowhere and nestled hidden in the Bliss - a Cronenbergian
  netherworld that only you can access. Guarded by the all-mighty Eldritches, the
  gardens of the Bliss are dangerous places. But as you do the monster's bidding,
  you will uncover the mystery of who Lady Bliss is and why she chose you for her
  secret mission.
  .
  Immerse yourself in over 40 hours of gameplay
  .
  Inspired by the real French Revolution events, characters, and architecture,
  Liberte pulls you into a world on the brink of annihilation. We emphasized real
  decisions in roguelike runs, and going through all available paths will now
  allow you nearly 40 hours of gameplay. You will witness body horrors,
  participate in political maneuvers and attempted assassinations, and see Madam
  Guillotine leaving a trail of blood.

  The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria follows the Dwarves as they embark on a
  new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty
  Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the
  iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as
  mysterious dangers await.
  .
  Reclaim the Dwarven homeland of Moria
  .
  Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control
  of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven
  homeland of Moria--known as Khazad-dum or Dwarrowdelf--in the depths below their
  very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of
  Moria to recover its treasures.
  .
  Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will
  be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with
  companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware
  mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the
  dangers below: where there's clatter, there's combat. Excavate the mysteries of
  three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and
  battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within.
  .
  Key Game Features:

  before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien
  interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.
  .
  -Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must
  conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature
  and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path
  further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of
  monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow
  that looms within the mountain.
  .
  -Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to
  create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from
  scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to
  destroy Dwarven progress.
  .
  -Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dum
  to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses.
  Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources.
  .
  -Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated
  environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger,
  providing a unique experience each and every time.
  .
  -Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online
  cooperative multiplayer with up to eight players.
  .
  -Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor,
  tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and
  enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines.
  .
  - Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that
  glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with
  forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom.
  .
  -Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources
  such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril.
  Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear.
  But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness.
  .
  -Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they
  create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be
  customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then,
  during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance
  their unique style.

  Lovecraft's Untold Stories is an action rogue-lite with RPG elements. You
  explore randomly generated levels based in H.P. Lovecraft stories, fighting
  cultists and all kinds of monsters from the Mythos, improving your weapons and
  gear, solving puzzles and challenges, and looking for clues and knowledge to
  defeat the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods.
  .
  LIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT'S STORIES
  .
  Lovecraft's Untold Stories is based on H.P. Lovecraft's stories. You will
  experience first-hand the cosmic horror created by the genius of Providence.
  Every character will go through an investigation that will take them through
  different locations, from the creepy old Victorian mansion to the abandoned
  hospital where forbidden experiments take place or the jungle where lost tribes
  celebrate forgotten rituals, just to name a few. Levels are randomly generated:
  it will be a different experience every time you play.
  .
  Also, they vary depending on the character you're playing with. Look for items
  and clues to unlock secrets and new stories!
  .
  5 CHARACTERS, 5 WAYS OF FIGHTING THE MYTHOS
  .
  You can play as 5 different characters, each with a different playstyle and
  storyline. A private detective, a witch, a thief, a professor, and even a ghoul
  --each with different stats, weapons, and combat moves, creating five entirely
  different gameplay experiences. The Detective offers a balanced playstyle, with
  average Health and Stamina. The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with
  less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The
  Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire
  and ice, but also a very low Health.
  .
  The Thief is a specialist in melee combat that takes advantage of its stealth to
  maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melee damage, has a high Health and
  regenerates itself, but can't use medkits at all.
  .
  DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE GREAT OLD ONES
  .
  The truth of the dark horrors that inhabit the universe is unbearable for any
  human mind. In the end, you can't win against the Old Ones. Madness or death
  await you. But maybe you can delay the inevitable... If you face the Great Old
  Ones without any knowledge about them, you will go mad just by looking at their
  hideous features. But spread across every level you will find special items with
  information about the Great Old Ones.
  .
  The more you know about them, the stronger your mind shall become - but
  knowledge is not easy to find, and if you are not thorough in your investigation
  you might get to the end of a storyline without finding everything that is to
  know. You will have to play with all the characters if you want to find all the
  information about every Great Old One!
  .
  MADNESS AWAITS
  .
  Insanity crawls behind every corner for those who face the Mythos. In your
  investigations, you will face different situations where you have to choose what
  to do - make the wrong decision and you will start losing your mind. In order to
  face the Great Old Ones, you need knowledge, and to find it you have to explore
  - but the more you explore the more events that shake your sanity you will
  find... Those who go mad under the influence of the Mythos take their own life
  to escape the eternal terror they are now looking at. Not all hope is lost,
  though - there are some ways to recover your sanity...
  .
  KEY FEATURES
  .
  Fight hundreds of different monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos in this intense
  action rogue-lite
  .
  Explore Lovecraft's stories: every character has a storyline that crosses
  randomly generated levels set in different locations from Lovecraft's stories,
  such as the hospital, the jungle, or the port city just to name a few
  .
  Face the Great Old Ones: Great Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, Shub-Niggurath, and
  Azathoth await you in special levels
  .
  Investigate thoroughly: explore every corner to find secret levels and knowledge
  about the Great Old Ones
  .
  Learn about the Mythos to fight them: to have a chance at fighting the Great Old
  Ones you need to acquire knowledge about them, or their mere presence will drive
  you insane
  .
  Madness awaits: in the course of your adventures you will have to make some
  decisions, and taking the wrong ones will shake your sanity. If it gets too low,
  you will start losing your mind - and if you go mad you will take your own life

  New Tales from the Borderlands
  .
  Take a stand against ruthless corporate overlords in this narrative-driven
  adventure!
  .
  Within the perpetually war-torn metropolis of Promethea, you'll control Anu,
  Octavio, and Fran on the worst day of their lives. Help these three lovable
  losers as they endeavor to change the world (and maybe even save it)! Face down
  a planetary invasion, vicious vault monster, and cold-hearted capitalist in this
  cinematic thrill ride where what happens next is up to you! Meet a motley cast
  full of misfits, assassin bots, and talking guns in this race to the top!
  .
  It's time to fight back against exploitation and corporate greed. It's time to
  make Mayhem your business.
  .
  THE UNDERDOG STORY OF THREE LOVABLE NOBODIES
  .
  Decide the fates of altruistic scientist Anu, her ambitious, "streetwise"
  brother Octavio, and the fierce, frogurt-slinging Fran. With nothing left to
  lose and everything to gain, you'll claw and con your way through this thrilling
  five-part story full of gun-toting goons, otherworldly beasts, and delicious
  tacos.
  .
  AN EXTRAORDINARY CINEMATIC ADVENTURE
  .
  The Borderlands aren't just home to Vault Hunters, psychos, and weapons-corp
  CEOs--they're full of downtrodden, intrepid civilians just trying to get by.
  With a host of returning and fresh faces, including an assassin bot with comedic
  aspirations and a less-murderous-than-usual bandit, this unforgettable tale is
  sure to delight fans new and old.
  .
  YOUR CHOICES SHAPE THE OUTCOME
  .
  The decisions you make determine how your story ends. Whether it's Anu's vision
  of a universe that markets more than weapons, Octavio's dreams of fame and
  fortune, or Fran's frosty plot for revenge--their success or failure depends on
  you.

description:
  The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian
  Entertainment and Private Division. Lost in transit while on a colonist ship
  bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find
  yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon
  colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various
  factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine
  how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony,
  you are the unplanned variable.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  * The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you
  approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the
  story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game
  scenarios.
  .
  * You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of
  flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While
  playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you
  aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the
  Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but
  rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional
  approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring
  Halcyon.
  .
  * Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you
  will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with
  unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and
  ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your
  own ends.
  .
  * Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy
  owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for
  the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony's two planets
  didn't exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and
  explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations
  throughout Halcyon.

  Introducing Project Winter 2.0: Cabin Fever
  .
  Project Winter 2.0: Cabin Fever is an 8-player survival and social deception
  game where teamwork is vital, but betrayal is inevitable. Face the wilderness,
  uncover traitors, and survive paranoia in this streamlined yet chaotic
  multiplayer experience.
  .
  ABOUT PROJECT WINTER
  .
  The ultimate test of trust and betrayal: do your friends have your back or will
  they leave you bleeding in the snow? Project Winter is an 8-person multiplayer
  game of survival and social deception, where cooperation is essential, but
  betrayal is inevitable.
  .
  Stranded in the frozen wilderness, survivors must gather resources, repair
  objectives, and fight the elements to escape. But hidden among them are traitors
  working together to sabotage, mislead, and eliminate their so-called allies.
  .
  Project Winter 2.0: Cabin Fever introduces a faster, more streamlined experience
  that keeps the paranoia and chaos alive while making it easier than ever for new
  players to jump in. For seasoned players, the punishing Classic mode remains -
  demanding coordination, grit, and sharp instincts to survive.
  .
  No two matches are ever the same. Whether you're chopping firewood with allies,
  whispering over secret radios as a traitor, or panicking when a sudden blizzard
  forces everyone together, the tension builds with every decision.
  .
  ROLES
  .
  Survivor
  .
  As a survivor you will have to complete a series of objectives in order to call
  in one of several rescue vehicles and escape to win the game.
  .
  Repair all the objectives to restore the cabin radio to working order.
  .
  Break rocks, harvest berries and herbs, and cut down trees to earn crafting
  materials used to repair objectives, and help keep you alive.
  .
  Explore crates found in the buildings scattered throughout the map which contain
  items that will help you survive and complete your objectives.
  .
  Traitor
  .
  As a traitor your goal is to stop the survivors from escaping without being
  identified or killed.
  .
  All of your teammates will be revealed to you at the start of the match and can
  be identified by a red traitor symbol, much like yours. You will start with a
  red radio to communicate with your fellow traitor.
  .
  Use traitor crates and hatches scattered throughout the map to gain advantage
  against survivors.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Teamwork & Survival: Survivors can't make it alone. Work together to endure the
  cold, complete objectives, and fend off wildlife.
  .
  Betrayal & Deception: Traitors blend in, gain trust, and then strike when the
  moment is right. Anyone could be the enemy!
  .
  Communication: Proximity voice, radio channels, text chat, and emotes keep every
  interaction charged with suspicion.
  .
  Multiple Modes: Choose between streamlined Cabin Fever, unforgiving Classic, or
  customize your own rules for the perfect dose of paranoia.
  .
  Cosmetics & Progression: Unlock stylish looks and personalize your character
  with cosmetics available in our in-game store, progression trees, or in-game

  Your job is simple - get to the last escape pod and get out alive.
  .
  Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter's icy moon
  Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard
  your job is simple - get to the last escape pod and get out alive.
  .
  But you aren't the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals - a deranged
  custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more - can't wait to
  step over your corpse and save themselves.
  .
  Only one of you can make it off the moon - make sure it's you!
  .
  FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT
  .
  Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your
  loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle
  through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot
  to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment
  with your strategy, and get out!
  .
  ROUT YOUR RIVALS
  .
  You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a
  bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your
  correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make
  escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one
  duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make
  it out in one piece.
  .
  FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE
  .
  When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated
  corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison's dangers to earn a powerful
  experiment. But beware, it's not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard
  has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra
  tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy.
  .
  DO OR DIE
  .
  You've made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals,
  killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you're standing in front of
  that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of
  freedom... or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the
  prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons.
  But IF you succeed, you'll unlock new powerful permanent gear.
  .
  FUTURE PUNK
  .
  An irreverent attitude, unique presentation, vivid graphic novel style, and a
  180bpm original arcade-punk soundtrack by Mutato Muzika enhance REDACTED 's sci-
  fi setting and fast white-knuckle action.

  City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other
  spots.
  .
  "IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"
  .
  Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no
  one is there to film it, it didn't really happen... In Session: Skate Sim, you
  can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor
  to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options,
  including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera
  views (tripod, orbit, etc.).
  .
  Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull
  off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of
  view of your camera operator and create the best clip.
  .
  CUSTOMIZATION
  .
  Show off your style with an extensive customization system for your skater and
  skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops.
  You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.)
  from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net,
  Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others.
  .
  You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels,
  trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King,
  Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components
  (trucks, riser pads, wheels...) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones
  for your style and shred the most iconic spots!

  Looks cute, right? Making stars isn't as easy as you might think, but you aren't
  alone! Your work in the factory is supported by a variety of bots with many
  different capabilities. Some bots are able to lift heavy objects, and some can
  solve complex problems with lasers - which is a pretty enviable skill. Just make
  sure you keep your goggles on.

  automation and programming games, you have to work in sync with your bots from
  time to time. It's a team effort here at the Star Stuff factory in order to get
  those stars made. If at first you don't succeed, brush off that stardust and
  try, try again.

  The star factory is extremely forgiving and you won't even get fired. You can
  always reset, undo, and try puzzles over and over again. You can take breaks in
  this whimsical atmosphere with a stellar soundtrack. And remember, it's only
  been 32,767 rotations since the last major incident. You can help maintain that

  appearances. Every problem is a chance to learn something new.

  Over 150 celestial levels to tease your brain with even when you're on your

  You are part of the puzzles! Your bots can't do this on their own - you have to
  pitch in sometimes to help the machines solve the obstacles they face in the
  star-making process.
  .
  Simple but deep mechanics make this title accessible and family-friendly. Try
  playing along with a friend or family member nearby!
  .
  Unleash your creativity as you delve into coding logic to craft your own bot
  programs. And don't worry! Programming is just puzzle solving at the end of the

  About the Game
  .
  To The Rescue! is a dog shelter sim where you are responsible for taking care of
  cute dogs in need of homes. It's not all cuddles: running a shelter is a lot of
  work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their
  chances of finding the right forever homes.
  .
  Each day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can
  get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold
  fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find
  their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more
  dogs.
  .
  Support real-world charity
  .
  20% of the developer's profit from sales of To The Rescue! goes towards real dog
  shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation.
  .
  Every Dog is Unique
  .
  Each dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them
  distinctive and memorable.
  .
  Match dogs with adopter's needs
  .
  Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match
  their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.
  .
  Upgrade your shelter
  .
  If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe
  kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more!
  .
  Keep the shelter open
  .
  Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter.
  You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can
  keep helping dogs find homes.
  .
  Some dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait
  long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day.
  .
  ...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs!
  .
  Take Care of Dogs
  .
  Every dog is unique - Each dog is generated with its own traits, food
  preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to
  make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all
  kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters
  will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their
  preferences to increase the chances of adoption.
  .
  Fulfill their needs
  .
  Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy.
  It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It
  can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes.
  .
  Minigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can
  ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O' War,
  Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime
  .
  Manage the Shelter
  .
  Balance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are
  multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make
  sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses.
  .
  Each day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks
  and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and
  spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to
  be made.
  .
  Grow and Upgrade
  .
  Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more
  efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as
  you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows!
  .
  Make a Difference
  .
  Event-driven story - In To The Rescue!'s main story mode you can progress from
  housing dogs in your own garage to running a giant, efficient shelter of your
  own. There will always be events that keep you on your toes, and story threads
  that develop between them.
  .
  Fostering and Adopting - The most important part of running a shelter is helping
  animals find homes. Match dogs' traits with the preferences of visitors to
  maximize their chances of finding homes. Find fosters who can take care of dogs
  when you don't have room.
  .
  In-Game Community Impact
  .
  It's not just the shelter activities that you have to manage; you also must
  establish the shelter as part of the community. Host events, promote, educate,
  and make sure that you stay in a positive light.
  .
  Tough Decisions
  .
  -From the very beginning, we wanted to teach about the real world problems
  shelters face. The truth is that there are way more dogs and cats in need than
  shelters can handle. It can be hard for "no-kill" shelters to take in every
  animal in need.
  .
  Some dogs may be hard to adopt, rehabilitate, or find room for. No one wants to
  euthanize, but to raise awareness, we don't pretend it's not part of the job.
  It's not glorified or presented as an easy way out, but it's an important part
  of the experience.
  .
  That said, we do include the ability to opt out of engaging with the euthanasia
  mechanic.
