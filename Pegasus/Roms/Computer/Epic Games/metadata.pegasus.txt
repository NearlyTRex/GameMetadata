  You have to grow up

  "El Hijo - A Wild West Tale" is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in
  which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother.
  .
  As a six-year-old, "El Hijo" must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As
  he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and,

  lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert,
  and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.
  .
  A dangerous journey

  The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze
  their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded
  monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn't feel right and he plans his
  escape.

  Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as
  variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to
  increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product
  of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that "El Hijo" must traverse
  to reach his ultimate goal.

game: Lord of The Rings, The - Return to Moria (USA)

developer: Free Range Games
publisher: North Beach Games
genre: Action-Adventure;Survival
description:
  The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria follows the Dwarves as they embark on a
  new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty
  Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the
  iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as
  mysterious dangers await.
  .
  Reclaim the Dwarven homeland of Moria
  .
  Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control
  of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven
  homeland of Moria--known as Khazad-dum or Dwarrowdelf--in the depths below their
  very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of
  Moria to recover its treasures.
  .
  Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will
  be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with
  companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware
  mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the
  dangers below: where there's clatter, there's combat. Excavate the mysteries of
  three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and
  battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within.
  .
  Key Game Features:
  .
  -Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never
  before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien
  interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.
  .
  -Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must
  conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature
  and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path
  further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of
  monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow
  that looms within the mountain.
  .
  -Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to
  create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from
  scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to
  destroy Dwarven progress.
  .
  -Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dum
  to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses.
  Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources.
  .
  -Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated
  environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger,
  providing a unique experience each and every time.
  .
  -Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online
  cooperative multiplayer with up to eight players.
  .
  -Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor,
  tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and
  enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines.
  .
  - Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that
  glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with
  forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom.
  .
  -Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources
  such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril.
  Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear.
  But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness.
  .
  -Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they
  create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be
  customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then,
  during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance
  their unique style.

  Must Die! 2, where the War Mage and Sorceress have rebuilt the order and trained
  new young apprentices.

  mega flip trap and launch dozens of ragdolling orcs. Mount your mega boom barrel
  launcher and unleash pyrotechnic glory.

  It Never Stops - The legions of orcs keep coming long after the story is

  of course more tools for orc destruction!

developer: Obsidian Entertainment
publisher: Private Division
genre: Role-Playing;Western-Style
description:
  The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian
  Entertainment and Private Division. Lost in transit while on a colonist ship
  bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find
  yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon
  colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various
  factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine
  how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony,
  you are the unplanned variable.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  * The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you
  approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the
  story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game
  scenarios.
  .
  * You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of
  flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While
  playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you
  aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the
  Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but
  rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional
  approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring
  Halcyon.
  .
  * Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you
  will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with
  unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and
  ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your
  own ends.
  .
  * Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy
  owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for
  the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony's two planets
  didn't exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and
  explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations
  throughout Halcyon.

  Your job is simple - get to the last escape pod and get out alive.
  .
  Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter's icy moon
  Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard
  your job is simple - get to the last escape pod and get out alive.
  .
  But you aren't the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals - a deranged
  custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more - can't wait to
  step over your corpse and save themselves.
  .
  Only one of you can make it off the moon - make sure it's you!
  .
  FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT
  .
  Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your
  loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle
  through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot
  to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment
  with your strategy, and get out!
  .
  ROUT YOUR RIVALS
  .
  You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a
  bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your
  correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make
  escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one
  duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make
  it out in one piece.
  .
  FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE
  .
  When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated
  corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison's dangers to earn a powerful
  experiment. But beware, it's not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard
  has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra
  tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy.
  .
  DO OR DIE
  .
  You've made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals,
  killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you're standing in front of
  that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of
  freedom... or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the
  prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons.
  But IF you succeed, you'll unlock new powerful permanent gear.

  FUTURE PUNK

  Session: Skate Sim
  .
  AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY
  .
  With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet. You will
  need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real
  skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness
  and immersion.
  .
  Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem
  challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the
  unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim
  also includes full options customization, so you can enjoy the perfect
  experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to
  get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels!
  .
  THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE
  .
  Inspired by the golden age of street skating - the 1990s - Session: Skate Sim
  lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just
  you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that
  your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain
  locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for
  you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York
  City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other
  spots.
  .
  "IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"
  .
  Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no
  one is there to film it, it didn't really happen... In Session: Skate Sim, you
  can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor
  to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options,
  including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera
  views (tripod, orbit, etc.).
  .
  Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull
  off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of
  view of your camera operator and create the best clip.
  .
  CUSTOMIZATION
  .
  Show off your style with an extensive customization system for your skater and
  skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops.
  You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.)
  from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net,
  Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others.
  .
  You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels,
  trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King,
  Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components
  (trucks, riser pads, wheels...) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones
  for your style and shred the most iconic spots!

  Star Stuff is deceptively cute programming puzzle game for curious minds of all
  kinds. Join Mija, a brand-new star engineer, as they take on over 150 mind-
  bending factory puzzles.
  .
  Looks cute, right? Making stars isn't as easy as you might think, but you aren't
  alone! Your work in the factory is supported by a variety of bots with many
  different capabilities. Some bots are able to lift heavy objects, and some can
  solve complex problems with lasers - which is a pretty enviable skill. Just make
  sure you keep your goggles on.
  .
  Once you've programmed your bots, join in on the manual labor fun! Unlike most
  automation and programming games, you have to work in sync with your bots from
  time to time. It's a team effort here at the Star Stuff factory in order to get
  those stars made. If at first you don't succeed, brush off that stardust and
  try, try again.
  .
  The star factory is extremely forgiving and you won't even get fired. You can
  always reset, undo, and try puzzles over and over again. You can take breaks in
  this whimsical atmosphere with a stellar soundtrack. And remember, it's only
  been 32,767 rotations since the last major incident. You can help maintain that
  record!
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Exercise your brain. Automating bots is tricky, despite their whimsical
  appearances. Every problem is a chance to learn something new.
  .
  Over 150 celestial levels to tease your brain with even when you're on your
  mandated lunch break.
  .
  You are part of the puzzles! Your bots can't do this on their own - you have to
  pitch in sometimes to help the machines solve the obstacles they face in the
  star-making process.
  .
  Simple but deep mechanics make this title accessible and family-friendly. Try
  playing along with a friend or family member nearby!
  .
  Unleash your creativity as you delve into coding logic to craft your own bot
  programs. And don't worry! Programming is just puzzle solving at the end of the
  day.

  About the Game
  .
  To The Rescue! is a dog shelter sim where you are responsible for taking care of
  cute dogs in need of homes. It's not all cuddles: running a shelter is a lot of
  work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their
  chances of finding the right forever homes.
  .
  Each day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can
  get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold
  fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find
  their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more
  dogs.
  .
  Support real-world charity
  .
  20% of the developer's profit from sales of To The Rescue! goes towards real dog
  shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation.
  .
  Every Dog is Unique
  .
  Each dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them
  distinctive and memorable.
  .
  Match dogs with adopter's needs
  .
  Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match
  their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.
  .
  Upgrade your shelter
  .
  If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe
  kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more!
  .
  Keep the shelter open
  .
  Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter.
  You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can
  keep helping dogs find homes.
  .
  Some dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait
  long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day.
  .
  ...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs!
  .
  Take Care of Dogs
  .
  Every dog is unique - Each dog is generated with its own traits, food
  preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to
  make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all
  kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters
  will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their
  preferences to increase the chances of adoption.
  .
  Fulfill their needs
  .
  Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy.
  It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It
  can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes.
  .
  Minigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can
  ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O' War,
  Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime
  .
  Manage the Shelter
  .
  Balance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are
  multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make
  sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses.
  .
  Each day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks
  and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and
  spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to
  be made.
  .
  Grow and Upgrade
  .
  Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more
  efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as
  you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows!
  .
  Make a Difference
  .
  Event-driven story - In To The Rescue!'s main story mode you can progress from
  housing dogs in your own garage to running a giant, efficient shelter of your
  own. There will always be events that keep you on your toes, and story threads
  that develop between them.
  .
  Fostering and Adopting - The most important part of running a shelter is helping
  animals find homes. Match dogs' traits with the preferences of visitors to
  maximize their chances of finding homes. Find fosters who can take care of dogs
  when you don't have room.
  .
  In-Game Community Impact
  .
  It's not just the shelter activities that you have to manage; you also must
  establish the shelter as part of the community. Host events, promote, educate,
  and make sure that you stay in a positive light.
  .
  Tough Decisions
  .
  -From the very beginning, we wanted to teach about the real world problems
  shelters face. The truth is that there are way more dogs and cats in need than
  shelters can handle. It can be hard for "no-kill" shelters to take in every
  animal in need.
  .
  Some dogs may be hard to adopt, rehabilitate, or find room for. No one wants to
  euthanize, but to raise awareness, we don't pretend it's not part of the job.
  It's not glorified or presented as an easy way out, but it's an important part
  of the experience.
  .
  That said, we do include the ability to opt out of engaging with the euthanasia
  mechanic.

  Zombie Army 4: Dead War
  .
  Hitler's hordes are back for more in this spine-chilling shooter from the makers
  of Sniper Elite 4! Abominable occult enemies, epic weapons and a harrowing new
  campaign for 1-4 players await in 1940s Europe, as you fight to save humankind
  from undead Armageddon!
  .
  Shocking New Campaign
  .
  The resistance have defeated Zombie Hitler and cast him into Hell - but the dead
  rise once again with greater hunger than before!
  .
  Continue the alternate history of Zombie Army Trilogy in huge new levels, and
  uncover a sinister plan that takes the Survivor Brigade across Italy and beyond!
  .
  Fight the forces of darkness in corpse-riddled canals, survive a Zombie Zoo, and
  journey to dark, inexplicable places no person has been before...and lived to
  tell the tale!
  .
  Award-Winning Gunplay
  .
  Experience the genre-defining ballistics Rebellion made famous in the Sniper
  Elite series, and put it to good use against the shambling hordes of the damned!
  .
  Upgraded Kill Cams and Dismemberment
  .
  The X-Ray Kill Camera returns! Watch in gory-ous slow motion as bullets, bombs
  and more destroy bones and organs in X-ray. Marvel as your bullets tear off a
  rotten limb or two, and shiver as the dead KEEP COMING!
  .
  Deep Progression and Customisation
  .
  Build the slayer that suits you as you rank up! Fancy yourself a guardian angel?
  Take damage for your teammates! Like that turret so much? Why not take it with
  you? Then kill in style as you unlock new outfits, emotes and taunts!
  .
  Killer Melee
  .
  When the dead surround you, fight back with enhanced melee combat! Barge through
  crowds, stomp on heads and dispatch the living dead with fearsome takedown
  moves!
  .
  Epic Weaponry
  .
  Harness the power of fire, lightning, and divine essence to upgrade your guns at
  workbenches, and create homespun hell raisers! An assault rifle that shoots
  lightning? A pistol with a flaming Bayonet? Anything goes in humankind's last
  stand!
  .
  Monstrous Multitudes
  .
  Take on legions of ghoulish grabbers, hulking armoured elites, terrifying shadow
  demons, explosive suicide generals and a host of other surprises! When you're
  staring down the fleshy barrel of a ZOMBIE TANK, you'll wish you'd stayed behind
  the sofa!
  .
  Bigger, Badder Horde Mode
  .
  Extend your SLAYcation in the expanded Horde Mode. The longer you survive, the
  bigger the map gets. How long can you fight back without joining the horde of
  the LIVING DEAD?
