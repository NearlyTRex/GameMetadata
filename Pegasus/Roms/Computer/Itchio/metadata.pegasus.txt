description:
  Visit a quiet town in the Peruvian desert at night searching for spirits and
  taking photos, then sharing these pictures with locals who free-associate based
  on them. This game is based on time I spent with a brujo in the desert suburb of
  Cachiche, a town that was founded by witches during the Peruvian Inquisition.
  Here descendants of witches still live and continue to practice traditional
  healing and fortune-telling.
  .
  "What works here is that uncertainty space... In a number of places you'll see
  shadows that don't have a body. And you'll also see people discussing secrets in
  dark rooms or running past you hurriedly from behind fences. But this only adds
  to the underlying feeling of something sinister and ominous present, watching
  you, following you wherever you go..."

  "It's all pleasantly dizzying, like a fever dream."

  Don't go in there!

  adventures!
  .
  New DM? This micro-module gives you support in running a fight with some oozes
  without making you run off to the reference books, a little help making up NPC
  names, and some ideas for future encounters in the area, if that's useful to
  you. Hey, I'm just trying to help.

  10 Flights of Ballooning is a cornucopia of games based on the Balloon Trip mode
  in the original Balloon Fight.
  .
  Relish in discovering the different flavors of games.
  .
  What ingredients can be added, subtracted, substituted, etc. to the original
  recipe? What are the resulting dishes?
  .
  I don't know about you, but I'm hungry.
  .
  Enjoy!
  .
  Serious stuff:
  .
  This was made in a graduate class based on Pippin Barr's 2016 IndieCade East
  talk, "36 Reasons to Make the Same Game 36 Times."
  .
  10 Flights works on PC and Mac OSX. You can use a keyboard, a DualShock 4
  controller, or whatever Xbox controller you have (tested with Xbox One and Xbox
  360). There's a readme in there with more info, but I strongly suggest you just
  boot up the game and play and have a good time.
  .
  The credits are in the secret game. Try to unlock them and see all the people I
  thanked!
  .
  Update 5-1-2017
  .
  I fixed some typos in the credits and also made sure the Mac build is correct.
  Balloon Light should play correctly now, and a couple of other minor issues that
  nobody will ever notice were also fixed.

  10 games, each made in a week! Some were a bit of a bust, others were pretty
  rad.
  .
  These games are simple prototypes, proof of concepts, or unfinished works. This
  bundle serves as a bit of a time capsule for me, but also for the curious or
  those who might go on a similar journey!
  .
  Week 1 - DRIFTING Through Time
  .
  Theme: 10 seconds or less.
  .
  Turning your car sideways is SO COOL it FREEZES TIME! Drift to stop time, get as
  many laps as you can before time runs out!
  .
  Week 2 - Dog Ownership Simulator
  .
  Theme: Durational
  .
  Play with your dog! Click and drag to give it a spin, swipe on poos to clean
  them up!
  .
  Week 3 - Chillin' Bayside
  .
  Theme: Melbourne
  .
  A simple little physics toy inspired by summer holidays on the great ocean road.
  Kinda like playing around in a bath - click and hold the mouse to push stuff
  around :)
  .
  Week 4 - Paint the Town Red
  .
  Theme: Colour
  .
  Bounce around the world and paint as you go, cherry tomato! A game dedicated to
  a personal friend of mine.
  .
  Week 5 - RONG
  .
  Theme: Phsyics
  .
  An inter-dimensional pong remix, RONG has you sticking it out for the highest
  score! Made in collab. with divlauren!
  .
  Week 6 - ???
  .
  Theme: Legedermain
  .
  Originally supposed to be about a magician who had his many hats stolen, this
  unfinished puzzle platform has never seen the light of day.
  .
  Week 7 - Pineapple Pipeline
  .
  Theme: Camerawork
  .
  A simple skateboarding game down an infinite half-pipe. This game was inspired
  by fish-eye lenses used in skateboarding videos.
  .
  Week 8 - Tandem Toobs
  .
  Theme: Gift
  .
  I made this game as a gift for my parents. Currently unfinished, but intended to
  be a co-op platformer, each player controls one half of two cylinders, and has
  to co-ordinate to move around.
  .
  Week 9 - Beach Bird Volleyball
  .
  Theme: Minigame
  .
  Beach Bird Volleyball stars buff seagulls using their floppy fists to fight it
  out in games of volleyball.
  .
  Week 10 - Mouse racing game
  .
  Theme: Weird Input
  .
  This game is played by turning your mouse upside down and revving up the
  mousewheel like a pullback car.
  .
  Week 11 - Spider Playground
  .
  Theme: Playground
  .
  Spider playground is a unfinished little sandbox where you can explore a
  climable(ish) playground as a tiny spider.
  .
  You may notice that some of these projects are already available for free on my
  page. That is no mistake! This package will have all my games as they were
  completed when I was working through my game-a-week journey. The games I've
  chosen to upload separately might receive updates in the future, and some
  already have.
  .
  This bundle is an honest record of my successes and failures. I've also decided
  to charge for this, as truthfully there was a lot of labour put into these
  projects. If you're not interested in strange and possibly broken games, check
  out my page for finished works. But if you do, I hope they can bring you as much
  joy as they've brought me :)

genre: Action
description:
  12 orbits is the only game for up to 12 players at once,
  .
  no matter what you play on.
  .
  All you need is a single keyboard, touchscreen, gamepad, dance mat, makey
  makey...
  .
  Features
  .
  Local competitive multiplayer for everyone at once. Anywhere. On anything.
  .
  4 vastly different game modes to choose from
  .
  Setup takes seconds, even for 12 players at once
  .
  The basic mechanics are simple and can be taught to a group quickly
  .
  ...yet the physical nature of the game provides you with a lot of room for
  mastery
  .
  One Switch accessible
  .
  You can choose from 4 vastly different game modes:
  .
  Multiball (Teams)
  .
  Kind of like football, but with exploding goals and multiple balls at once,
  which change color all the time.
  .
  Arena
  .
  Fill the arena with spheres of your own color and avoid those of your opponents.
  A bullet hell that constantly grows more intense.
  .
  Trails
  .
  Collect spheres to grow longer than your opponents. Block their path and pay
  attention to your own, similar to Snake or Achtung die Kurve / Zatacka. On top
  of that, you also have the ability to shoot with your own spheres.
  .
  Blizzard (Teams)
  .
  Think Pong. But you play in teams, can roam freely on your side of the court,
  and have to defend against a whole shower of spheres at once.
  .
  Some questions you might have:
  .
  * Why?
  .
  So you can play with everyone around you, anywhere. 12 orbits will run on almost
  any hardware, and any input will do. Most keyboards can only process 3 or 4
  inputs at the same time, but that does not mean you can only play with 3
  players.
  .
  12 orbits uses only one button per player, which you never have to keep pressed.
  So it is highly unlikely that many players use their button during the very same
  frame. While I can not guarantee that a three-button-keyboard will never ever
  miss a single input, there were no problems with any number of players yet.
  .
  If you are on the go, or simply do not have 12 gamepads lying around, that is
  why.
  .
  * Is this actually playable?
  .
  Yes! There are a few one-button-multiplayer games around that are fun or funny,
  but are based on a single action and don't really work for longer than 5
  minutes. 12 orbits is not one of those games. It is fun of course, but this is
  also a game that can actually be played competitively.
  .
  It will take you only a few minutes to get the hang of the controls, but it is
  much harder to actually master movement and to skillfully hit spheres exactly
  the way you want to. In addition, 12 orbits is a lot about anticipating the
  movements of other players, becoming almost chess-like if you have the right
  opponents.
  .
  You can of course also play the game in a more relaxed fashion, especially in
  the team modes or with activated modifications. It's your choice.
  .
  * How many players do I need?
  .
  2 is enough. All game modes automatically adjust to any number of players. There
  are also practice modes that can be played with 1 to 12 players on one team, but
  that isn't the main attraction of this game. So grab someone nearby, and add
  players as they turn up.
  .
  * Is 12 orbits One Switch accessible?
  .
  Yes. From the moment the game starts, it can be completely controlled with only
  the spacebar, including all menus. Just press it a few times when the main menu
  screen is shown, and on-screen prompts will further guide you through the
  process. More infos here.
  .
  * Is there a colorblind mode?
  .
  Yes. It is based on black and white symbols, so it should work for any type of
  color blindness.

  CONTENT WARNING:
  .

  Please let me know if you find any bugs!
  .
  Hello. My name is Anxiety. Here, on your shoulder. This is your first day of
  high school.
  .
  You don't belong here.
  .
  In the dim, abandoned halls of the school, there are monsters - monsters with
  names like Guilt and Dysphoria, Insomnia and the Expectations that you can't
  seem to clear. With no clear way to leave, no way to get rid of the monsters,
  and no one to help, things are looking pretty bleak. The Anxiety that
  accompanies you sure seems to think so.
  .
  But remember, even in the darkest of places, you can't let your hope die. It's
  okay to get hurt, and it's okay to fall. And, most importantly: never give up.
  .
  --------
  .
  In 2016, just before I graduated from high school, I was asked to make a
  presentation on my last 1365 days at the school. I realized that I couldn't
  really remember, thanks to my many mental illnesses. So, instead, I made a game
  about what I could remember: a hostile world, bleak and full of inescapable
  monsters, but a world that I had just made it out of in one piece. 1365 is a
  reflection of my own struggles in overcoming Anxiety, Depression, and other such
  monsters of the mind, specifically in the context of public school.
  .
  While my understanding of myself and my world have changed drastically since I
  first started working on this game, I opted to keep the original concept intact.
  I've remade the original game entirely and added a few features that I didn't
  have time for, but otherwise the game is a time capsule to three years ago, when
  I finished its first incarnation.
  .
  Nearly every part of 1365 was made by me, including graphics, sound, code,
  writing, and concept. The only parts that weren't are the fonts (the main one is
  Little Monster by Jack Oatley), and the game engine itself, built by the Godot
  team. I couldn't have done it without them.
  .
  So, three years after its initial creation, I'm proud to present: 1365. I hope
  you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

  .
  "Towards the end of the interstellar wars, chaos spread
  .
  and one band of elite mercenaries acted more like pirates
  .
  and looters than actual soldiers. The leader of this group
  .
  was the notorious and infamous Colonel Nestor.
  .
  Without a doubt the biggest prize of their looting campaigns
  .
  was the Spacemachine: a device designed to terraform barren
  .
  planets and making them habitable. With this device, and the rest
  .
  of their treasure, Nestor and his men started to build an army
  .
  that now poses a great threat to the known star systems.

  Mission: Bring back the Space Machine."

description:
  2000:1: A Space Felony is a murder mystery courtroom drama set aboard the USS
  Endowment, an interplanetary Spacecraft that has lost communication with Earth.
  .
  Utilising your camera and demonstrating your keen detective skills, you must
  document your findings, and piece together the crew's final hours from the
  aftermath. This photographic evidence is then applied in a cross-examination of
  the crime's prime suspect; MAL, the ship's on-board AI system.
  .
  If MAL is guilty, it is your responsibility to deactivate him.
  .
  A follow-up(ish) to 2016's critically acclaimed(ish) Disorient On The Murder
  Express, National Insecurities returns with a much more ambitious investigation
  that walks the line between science and fiction, resulting in some kind of
  combination of the two.

game: 2064 - Read Only Memories (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/#-0/2064 - Read Only Memories (USA)/2064 - Read Only Memories (USA).json
developer: MidBoss, Kossio, JJSignal
publisher: MidBoss, Kossio, JJSignal
genre: Cyberpunk;Speculative fiction;Adventure
description:
  2064: Read Only Memories merges old-school adventure gaming with modern
  storytelling to explore some of the social challenges we will face in the near
  future. Explore the colorful future metropolis of Neo-San Francisco, meeting a
  huge cast of fascinating characters and solving a far-reaching mystery. Think
  carefully about your choices, because you never know how they will affect this
  dynamic, branching narrative further down the line.
  .
  The world is changing.
  .
  Genetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically
  alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called
  ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital
  assistants, are exerting greater control over people's lives. Some are terrified
  by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent
  it.
  .
  A lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to
  ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machine-not a simulation of
  life but a genuinely self-aware artificial being-and the technical genius who
  created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that
  threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the
  bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you?
  .
  Old-school, cutting-edge - Classic point-and-click adventuring inspired by the
  likes of Gabriel Knight and Snatcher is melded with modern branching
  storytelling that delves into identity, individuality, and what it means to be
  human.
  .
  People of the future - Get to know a diverse cross-section of Neo-SF's
  population, brought to life by some of the best voice talent working in games
  today, including Melissa Hutchison and Dave Fennoy (The Walking Dead), Erin
  Yvette (Oxenfree), Austin Creed (WWE's Xavier Woods), and internet stars Jim
  Sterling (Jimquisition) and SungWon Cho (ProZD).
  .
  High tech nostalgia - The city of Neo-San Francisco is rendered in beautiful
  pixel art, and your adventure is accompanied by a catchy low-fi electronic synth
  soundtrack.
  .
  Solve the mystery - Enjoy over ten hours of adventure gaming goodness, featuring
  exploration, dynamic branching conversations, multiple endings, and many
  challenges to overcome.
  .
  The definitive PC edition - Since its launch two years ago, the team has made
  many improvements and additions to an already amazing game, making this the
  ultimate version. Additions have included new characters and voice performers,
  additional facial animations, Japanese language support, and the "Endless
  Christmas" extended epilogue that allows you to hang out with your favorite Neo-
  SF locals.
  .
  More about the Sights & Sounds of Neo-SF Deluxe Edition
  .
  Sights of Neo-SF (Artbook)
  .
  The world of 2064 can be hard to navigate. The Sights of Neo-SF is the official
  art book by Read Only Memories director and lead artist John "JJSignal" James.
  Highly stylized and specific in its visuals, ROM's progression from early
  sketches to final form is fully outlined in this 50-page PDF. You will see early
  concepts fully realized, previous versions of your favorite characters and even
  some characters that didn't make the final cut. JJ lists Bubblegum Crisis,
  Akira, Megazone 23, and the Pluto manga as his biggest style inspirations. Come
  see where the ideas behind the game began and watch them evolve into the vibrant
  city of Neo-SF we know and love.
  .
  Sounds of Neo-SF (Soundtrack)
  .
  Composed by 2 Mello, the Sounds Of Neo-SF is the FM-synthy, funky, and
  positively-charged soundtrack to MidBoss' cyberpunk adventure game Read Only
  Memories. Not content with a soundtrack that was merely fitting for its game, 2
  Mello crafted these sounds to embody the dual nature of Neo-San Francisco, all
  its charm and its hidden dangers. But who said that our cyberpunk future has to
  be dark and dreary? You'll be humming these melodies to 2064 and beyond.

  of bucks, so if you can't swing twelve bucks, drop me a line, and I'll totally

  .
  What is a "game poem"? Basically, it's a little game that you can pick up and
  play in fifteen minutes or so, give or take.There's no preparation time, nothing
  to get between you and playing immediately.They generally address some specific
  mood or emotion, or focus on one particular notion, but not all of the games
  here strictly adhere to that definition. First and foremost, a game poem is just
  there to be taken in and experienced with a friend or group of friends for a few
  moments, and then those moments are over - and hopefully, something small and
  wonderful will happen in the process.
  .
  (I guess folks are calling these "lyric games" now? So, that's cool, it's
  awesome to see a billion of these out now!)

developer: Dice Pencil & Paper
publisher: Dice Pencil & Paper
genre: Adventure;Card Game;Role Playing
description:
  52 Fates is a unique, easy to play tabletop RPG system that uses a single,
  standard 52-card deck for all game mechanics. Three character classes (fighter,
  herald, and mage), diverse backgrounds for unique characters, four magic types,
  low hit points, and interesting strategic play options make this an unique
  proposition among tabletop role-playing games. Just get a deck of cards, papers
  and pencils to keep track of game events, and you're ready to go!
  .
  52 Fates frees players from the uncontrolled, random results of throwing dice,
  as they need to make conscious choices on which cards to use, when to use them,
  which cards to save for later, and how many cards to use in a certain play. This
  adds a deep layer of player agency and strategic thinking. It brings a
  completely new type of play where the player has some level of control over a
  character's fate that goes beyond role-playing decisions.
  .

  which has a distilled rule set with the basics! Get the 52 Fates Zine here!

  I like making games. Sometimes i make them just for the sake of making them and
  to enjoy the process. Here are 6 things that are too small to be posted or sold
  on their own, but are still something I'm proud of and want to share with the
  world.
  .
  Includes versions for all major OS + sourcecode for godot projects
  .
  Chat Stashers:
  .
  RP as undercover agents transmitting secret messages in plain sight. Played in
  your groupchat of choice, preferably full of people who are not aware you & your
  pals are playing. Includes a rulebook and a spreadsheet to keep track of active
  stashes and score. Inspired by the Stashers Bible, a russian essay of tips &
  best practices on how to make deaddrops in an urban environment.
  .
  Bubble Herder:
  .
  This January i joined a 2 day hackathon. For that hackathon i made a bubble
  diagram maker where bubbles can push and pull on each other to organize
  themselves. It ended up getting first place. I quite like it myself as well, so
  it will likely be turned into a full scale project when i have enough free time
  to do that.
  .
  Planet Maker:
  .
  Procedural planet generator, looks pretty, sounds nice. You can make some dope
  wallpapers from it, or just sit and ponder the orb. Was an experiment in using
  bitwise XOR shader to make something that is neither intense nor ugly colored,
  grew a bit too big for my shader collection project.
  .
  Ladybug Window:
  .
  This autumn, on warm sunny days ladybugs would come and chill on my window at
  sunset. They were very calm and i enjoyed their presence. This vignette attempts
  to capture the vibe of those evenings for you and future me to enjoy.
  .
  Games fast:
  .
  I make a lot of small things from scratch all the time. This taught me some
  stuff. Wrote a condensed 3 page thing about how to make small things really
  fast. Idk if it's good advice, so don't be too mad if it doesn't work.
  .
  Desktop Incense Burner:
  .
  Love watching the incense smoke, it's got good vibes. I like things with good
  vibes, so i made a vignette that recreates that. Burns in real time, stick runs
  out after 10 ish minutes, relaunch application to reset it.
  .
  The pricing & its history:
  .
  In the spirit of doing weird wacky things for their own sake, as with the rest
  of the pack, the pricing was also wacky and utilized the Fibonacci sequence
  pricing (patent pending). It sold 16 numbered copies, each more expensive than
  the last, with #1 selling for 0.01$ and #16 selling for 9.87$
  .
  Nobody bought a new copy of the bundle for over 2 months as of 1650239400 and I
  don't expect that to change. This made me think that doing the following 2
  things would be funny:
  .
  release the project files under this funky license
  .
  remove the ability to buy this project*
  .
  *you can probably find a way to get the files from another person or the
  internet
  .

  Set fifteen minutes into the future, AIdol is about a new craze that's been
  sweeping Japan: virtual idols.
  .
  Virtual idols look like normal humans, but they're made of wire and circuitry.
  They can sing better, dance better, and entertain better than any human could
  ever hope to, and their devotion to their jobs is unfailing.
  .
  The protagonist, Hana, is a young high school student who loves virtual idols -
  particularly Aiko. Aiko is the postergirl of the famous company Lyriq, and one
  of the most popular virtual idols to ever exist. Aiko is the nation's darling,
  and though Hana adores her, she knows she'll never get a chance to speak to her.
  Aiko is simply too far out of her reach.
  .
  That is, until one day, when somebody claiming to be Aiko starts sending Hana
  text messages asking for help. Aiko tells Hana that she's in severe danger of
  malfunctioning, and the only person who can save her is her original
  programmer... but nobody seems to know where they are, and nobody is willing to
  help her.
  .
  Left with no alternatives, it's up to Hana (and an eclectic cast of characters
  she meets along the way) to save Aiko from being turned into scrap metal!
  .
  A sweet, family-friendly story about making friends, going on adventures, and
  the power of music!

genre: Role Playing
description:
  ANTological Theory is a GM-less tabletop comedy game for 3-5 players, who take
  the roll of ant philosophers debating in the Hive. You will debate about a
  variety of randomly chosen topics; the nature of Food, an ant's sense of self,
  the importance of the Queen, and even the trolley problem. Gameplay can be fast
  paced, or players can spend a lot of time debating one of the random topics at
  their leisure. The entire rules fit on a single page, and you'll just need two
  six-sided dice.

game: Above - The Fallen (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/A/Above - The Fallen (USA)/Above - The Fallen (USA).json
developer: Hexnite
publisher: Hexnite
genre: Platformer
description:
  Above: The Fallen is a 2D side-scrolling, puzzle - platformer game that is
  centered around travelling upwards instead of to the left or right. The goal is
  to climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to break through
  the canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same time throughout
  the game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark forest.
  .
  Mankind has been driven from their homes among the trees by the Night King, a
  nightmarish beast whose origin has been lost to time. Now, man lives in the
  dirt, fearing the moments the Night King leaves his roost to prey upon their
  vulnerable forms.
  .
  Every generation the elders send a young couple out into the world to find a new
  home for their people where they need not fear the relentless hunger of the
  Night King. Every generation these journeys have failed. This time however, the
  young couple has decided to ascend into the trees and reclaim their ancestral
  home instead of fleeing into the darkness. Can they rise above?
  .
  Controlling 2 Characters with 1 GamePad
  .
  In Above: The Fallen, you play as both the male and female characters at the
  same time (Single Player Mode Only). They often find themselves in situations
  that require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the
  canopy. Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers
  an additional challenge and requires you to think about each character's
  positioning before moving. If you don't get the hang of it right away, don't
  worry, it won't be long before you're climbing through the jungle like Tarzan.
  .
  Single Player or Co-op mode!
  .
  Bring a friend along with you as you adventure through the world, solve puzzles
  and work together to defeat the Night King. Swap back and forth easily from
  single player to co-op with a push of a button.
  .
  Vertical Scrolling / Climbing
  .
  Climbing is essential to the goal of reaching the forest's canopy. This differs
  from traditional side-scrollers where you generally move in a straight line
  throughout the world.
  .
  Puzzles
  .
  There are many interesting puzzles that you'll come across as you play. Some
  puzzles are solvable in multiple ways which allows for some freedom to explore.
  Each successfully completed puzzle brings you closer to facing the Night King!
  .
  Skills
  .
  As you progress through the world you'll come across shrines that when
  activated, interact with your amulet, and unlock ancient magic hidden away from
  humanity. The character's will then receive a new skill which will be needed to
  complete upcoming puzzles.
  .
  Enemies
  .
  There are many animals to watch out for while exploring the forest. Use caution
  while approaching them though, they don't like being disturbed.

  Exploration, brawls, strange chimeras, a heist in a thieves' school, kobolds

  These adventures were written and (mostly) illustrated by Jan Van Houten, edited
  and laid out by Nicolas Folliot. They are compatible with your favorite TTRPG,
  but if you want to take the opportunity to discover a new one, there's
  Sodalitas, a tiny tabletop roleplaying game to play for an hour or so with too
  many young players.
  .
  Thanks to a progressive financing of this first season, we were able to invite
  several illustrators of wide variety of styles and backgrounds to come and draw
  some adventures (in chronological order):
  .
  Franois Maumont (The Baron's First Dungeon, adventure #8)
  .
  Evlyn Moreau (Magus Moreau's Island, adventure #9)
  .
  lodie Shanta (Mysteries & Tentacles, adventure #11)

  Helkarava (Wizard Tower for Sale, adventure #14)
  .
  Sax la Bagarre (The Game, adventure #15)

  Are you an educator?

  These adventures as well as the game Sodalitas have been designed for you, and
  we want you to be able to get as many children as possible playing, so for you
  it's free if you want it! Just send a message to education@jdr.cool to introduce

  download the demo first and check if it runs ok before making any purchase.

  Heads up!
  .
  The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated
  machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines
  and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind
  you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any
  fear of missing out on game content.
  .
  Please download and play the demo before making a purchase!
  .
  I don't want to mislead anyone into spending money on the game. That's why I
  made this demo version, so you can try it and see for yourself if you like it
  and if it works properly on your machine. And only then buy the game, if you
  consider it's worth your money.

  Issue Two of AeTHERJACK'S ALMANAC your source for semi-weird space-fantasy for
  Troika! is here in both eye rending color and safe for life black & white.
  Contains one background, stats for a warship, stats for two different NPC
  versions of the warship. Conversion from the vintage science-fantasy setting not
  enough people love & brief combat rules for space combat.

  It's a zini which means it's exactly one sheet of US letter paper folded in

  Troika] pair well with...Aetherjack's Almanacs;" I agree so check out Icy City
  Troika. You wont regret it.

  "Ian Woolley delivers big time here - on just two pages, you get a great,
  mechanically precise engine that lets you seamlessly convert space
  ships/spacefaring ships/vehicles to Troika!, and we get some default stats as
  orientation, and a neat high-risk background. What more could you want? This is
  a resounding success of a mini-zine. Final verdict: 5 stars." - Thilo Graf /

genre: Card Game
description:
  Please note, this is the print-and-play version!!
  .
  If you'd like to purchase a pre-printed, boxed deck, see its "thegamecrafter"
  page!
  .
  -----
  .
  You and your companion(s) awaken in a realm unlike your own.
  .
  Divine machines glitter from every side of the room, and ask about yourself and
  those around you.
  .
  To make it back home, answer them honestly and reveal your truth to not just the
  automatons... but to the partner(s) you are sitting with.
  .
  The only way to win is to be vulnerable.
  .
  -----
  .
  Card Types:
  .
  In this deck are three types of cards, indicated by the number of eyes in the
  circle symbol on the card backs.
  .
  One eye = lighthearted cards that are easy to play with friends both old and new
  .
  Two eyes = cards that you would typically ask people to become closer friends
  .
  Three eyes = these are the cards that ask you to share more with a partner
  .
  -----
  .
  Gameplay:
  .
  There are several ways to use this deck. Here is one way I know of, but in your
  journey in the emotional robot world, you might come up with something even
  better:
  .
  Set the Scene: If possible, please set up the table/space to make you and your
  partner(s) comfortable. Some examples are:
  .
  Set down a tablecloth/blanket/scarf for the cards to be laid out on
  .
  Light some candles (or use battery-operated ones)
  .
  Sit in a circle of items that are beloved by you and your partner(s)
  .
  Stack the deck (Optional): Some cards in the deck work better for certain
  situations. You and your partner should lay out the cards and decide:
  .
  What cards am I excited to potentially get in my hand?
  .
  What cards make me feel restless/uneasy right now?
  .
  Based on your comfort level, select what cards will be in that session's deck.
  .
  Shuffle and Draw Cards: After shuffling the deck, players draw a card (if there
  are enough cards per person). If there aren't, decide who will get a card.
  .
  A Speaker Begins: Whoever is most comfortable to speak to one of their cards
  will go first. They are the Speaker, and will lay a card face up in the center
  of the table. The Speaker will answer the card and have a chance to decide if
  they want to voice any Needs (see rules for suggestions).
  .
  Listener(s) Response: While the Speaker is taking their turn, Listeners must pay
  attention to what they say, and earnestly Respond (see rules for suggestions).
  After Responding, the Listener can choose to share an answer to the Speaker's
  card in return.
  .
  Continue The Cycle: Players will continue to become Speakers in a clockwise
  manner. Once the group feels satisfied with the interaction, you may decide -
  Are you and the divine machines satisfied with the answers shared between you?

  It's been ten years since the war. The Song was our enemy, a memetic virus which
  indoctrinated its victims into the Great Choir. The Song spread like a galactic
  cancer and overran the defenses of our multi-species Galactic Union. The Earth
  was scorched, Martian domes cracked, and the Belt was broken.

  Millions of survivors fled our ruined homeworlds on the Exodus Fleet. We
  developed a terrible memetic weapon to strike back at the Great Choir. Now the
  song is dormant and we have a chance to rebuild on the frontier world of Polvo.

  After the War is a tabletop science-fiction roleplaying game of memetic horror.
  Ten years after the galactic war, millions of survivors try to rebuild on the

  Survivors of the galactic war, who refused to surrender to the horror.

  Believers, whose passionate hearts and fervent convictions drive them.

  Dreamers, with a vision of a brighter future lighting your way.

  PLAYTEST MATERIAL
  .
  This is the playtest version of the Against the Fall of Night TTRPG.  More about
  the playtest status can be found below.  What this means, in short, is that you
  can expect limited or no art, formatting, and incomplete rules all over the
  place.  Your one-time purchase will entitle you to all playtest updates made,
  right up until the final playtest version.  The final playtest version will be
  the complete text of the game, but will be missing elements like art and layout.
  The release version will be available separately when it is completed.
  .
  Against the Fall of Night
  .
  Against the Fall of Night (AFN) is a TTRPG about fighting against the coming
  darkness.  The Night will fall.  You can't stop it.  That the fight is
  impossible makes it no less important.  You can't stop the Night, but by
  bringing together and protecting as much as you can, you can keep the world
  together long enough to see the Dawn.
  .
  In the world of AFN, Night does not refer merely to what happens when the sun
  goes down.  Night is an existential force, the terror that lies beyond, the
  darkness from without, a force and a place that is not of our world, but that
  wants very badly to make our world like it.  Every day when the world shelters
  your view from the sun, that's not Night.  That's just an ordinary night.  Night
  is a longer cycle, when darkness creeps out from the places between shadows.
  When silence rings out, clear as a bell.  When every mistake you have made,
  every fear you have, every dream you have been denied, rushes into your thoughts
  with crystal clarity.  These things are the first stirrings of a true Night.
  Night is a slow corruption of the normal, a destruction of safety, a denial of
  predictability.  When you hear a strange noise at 3 am, it could be anything.
  In the clear light of day, that was obviously just the house settling.  At 3 am,
  it could have been an intruder or a monster or an extradimensional rift.  These
  impressions are the leakage of true Night into any ordinary night.  In an
  ordinary night, it is a passing fear, pushed away and laughed at nervously
  later.  In true Night; who can say what fear might reveal, or what might pass
  through the darkness?
  .
  Night has fallen before, and it will fall again.  Every time, the Dawn has come,
  its clear light banishing the Night.  By default, an AFN campaign is set at
  Nightfall, when the Night is just beginning.  Will your heroes be able to defend
  the world against the encroaching Night, and protect it long enough for Dawn to
  end this cursed Night?  Will Night find a way to banish the light of hope, and
  prevent the Dawn from ever arriving?
  .
  Night falls, but heroes rise.  In AFN, you play those heroes.  With unique yet
  intuitive mechanical innovations, AFN keeps combat fresh and interesting without
  bogging itself down in the details.  Powered by the Nightfall Engine, AFN aims
  to make sure that every choice offered to a player is an interesting choice; we
  don't believe that you need to waste your time making obvious choices or false
  choices.  Resolution is quick and easy, using a system of Tests and Checks;
  Tests are rolled on a d20 and always have a fixed target number (10), while
  Checks are rolled on 2d6 and have varied TN by difficulty.  In combat,
  characters spend Attack Points, Defense Points, and Magic Points to use combat
  techniques and cast spells, allowing all characters to make interesting choices
  with every action they take; but make sure you don't leave yourself open, as an
  attack that catches you off guard can cause serious harm to even an experienced
  hero.
  .
  In addition to the playtest document, a short introductory adventure is
  included, Heroes Rise.  The heroes have found a village that has become a
  Nightmare.  They must find the Anchor and defeat it to cleanse the Nightmare.
  .
  PLAYTEST MATERIAL
  .
  This is a playtest document.  The current version is Playtest 0.4.  Playtest 0.4
  contains a full and complete core game system, along with all classes fully
  playable from level 1-6.  (The level cap in AFN is 6.)
  .
  A selection of feats, spells, rituals, combat techniques, monsters, and magic
  items are included.  More of these have been added in each version since 0.1;
  further expansion of these elements are planned.
  .
  Hints at what a setting region might be like are included.  Expansion of the
  setting is planned.
  .
  Random generation tables for Nightmare elements are included, along with a
  procedural generation system for building and evolving Nightmares as gameplay
  progresses.  Further refinement of these tables is planned.
  .
  There is no art included, and no editing, layout, or sensitivity reading has

  In Airships: Conquer the Skies you'll need to use all of your creativity and
  skill to design and build fearsome airships and land vehicles to give you the
  edge in massive aerial battles.
  .
  Construct your vehicles by piecing together a vast array of modules, choosing
  weapons, armour types, structures, equipment and resources in near endless
  configurations to allow you to prevail against even the toughest foes.
  .
  The vehicles are highly detailed, teeming with sailors moving around performing
  their individual tasks to stay in the fight. Your choices of vehicle layouts are
  crucial, exploring the design space of different crafts and their matching
  tactics to make sure your fleet emerges victorious.
  .
  Once your vehicles are ready for the fight, you'll give high-level commands to
  your small fleet, swooping, soaring, ramming and boarding others to gain the
  upper hand in battle. Ships and terrain are fully destructible: they can catch
  fire, explode, break apart, and fall, so you'll need to choose your tactics
  wisely.
  .
  Face off against giant aerial kraken, fleshcracker mechs, huge venomous spiders,
  clockwork wasps, and more. Defeat them and reap the rewards.
  .
  Play across three distinctly different modes: taking on (or creating your own)
  bespoke Missions; building a mighty empire in Conquest, or destroying your
  friends in Multiplayer matches online or via LAN.

  Story
  .
  Take control of a modern hero of our times, a man so lazy he decided to quit his
  job and just spend his life inside an All-you-can-eat diner.
  .
  As years go by, his freeloading nature becomes legend, but then a tragedy occurs
  - the diner is about to close down! Will our hero finally settle down and get a
  regular job?
  .
  Never!!!
  .
  Embark on an epic quest filled with humor, puns and controversy as you traverse
  the city in search of a solution to your life's problems.
  .
  Memorable characters include yourself, your dad who is also your only friend, a
  very foxy secretary love interest (but that just doesn't work out... at all),
  and half a dozen more
  .
  The plot takes a dark turn when the CEO of a Megaslimy corporation and the Mayor
  of whatever team up to do some evil.
  .
  Can you stop them and more importantly - do you even care?
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  All You Can Eat is a unique interactive comic that blends the mechanics of
  .
  playing a game seamlessly with the experience of reading a comic:
  .
  every interaction in the game world (such as talking, picking up items, using
  objects etc.) creates a new comic panel, furthering the story
  .
  at any time during the game you can scroll up and down to read what you've
  created among hundreds of unique hand-drawn (and hand-scanned!) content rich
  panels
  .
  the in-game conversations mimic the "3 panel structure" of daily comics with
  context, setup and delivery
  .
  when the player ends the game, he is given the option to print out his gameplay
  in a comic book format
  .
  a new game+ option with a developer commentary track when you finish the game

  Praise for Anamnesis
  .
  "Anamnesis sent me down an eye-opening rabbit hole as far as what a TTRPG could
  be. Tender, personal, thought-provoking, moving, terrifying, raw."
  .
  - Shawn Drake, designer of HEDGE and Court of Blades
  .
  "As an author, I love the potential of Anamnesis to help me generate random
  fictional scenarios. As I played, it became obvious that the game could also be
  used for self-reflection. Samantha has created a unique, powerful experience - I
  absolutely recommend Anamnesis for everyone who loves stories."
  .
  - Tanya Schofield, author of the Melody's Song trilogy
  .
  "Anamnesis invites you to sway and stumble through a journey of Proustian
  discoveries. Dwelling in the quiet connections between loss, discovery, and
  renewal, the game guides you through the creation of a world that can bloom and
  welcome, overwhelm and frighten, asking with a quiet persistence: Who are you?"
  .
  - Sean Patrick Cain, designer of Long Haul 1983
  .

  you're on a quest to let cuteness rule!

  Beware of the Brainwash Patrol
  .
  The Brainwash Patrol won't let you do all this without resistance. They have a
  huge arsenal at hand : snipers, drones and even helicopters... You will need to
  master your crowd and its powers to be victorious.

description:
  Pursued through the ruined streets of Los Angeles, harried by a roving Kill
  Gang, perhaps it was simple survival instinct that drove you to seek shelter.
  But perhaps it was Fate which drove you to seek shelter in the offices of
  Wayfarer Inc. In their subterranean laboratories, you discover a machine which
  opens up a portal to another world. Wayfarer had just had enough time to send
  one expedition thought the gate before they had evacuated.
  .
  Seeking escape from the Kill Gang beating down the doors, you activate the
  device, open the portal, and step through...
  .
  You are greeted by a lush and dangerous world of verdant forest and acid lakes,
  rocky crags and networks of caves. Up on a high plateau, you see a geodesic dome
  shimmering under a pink sky. Perhaps if you can reach it, you may find the first
  expedition... or at least find out what became of them.
  .
  And All Would Cry Beware is a old-school-style fast-paced FPS with a
  Metroidvania structure. Explore a connected world, discover what became of the
  Lost Expedition. Find new guns which will allow you to reach new areas. Weave
  through enemy projectiles and take on fearsome bosses.

  Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures and Angry Video Game Nerd II: Assimilation come
  together for the ultimate Nerd experience! FreakZone Games and Screenwave Media
  Games presents the definitive way to play the series... Angry Video Game Nerd I
  & II Deluxe!
  .
  This deluxe collection brings you every stage from both famously tough action
  platform games, remixed & re-balanced-plus an all-new, never-before-seen final
  chapter for the ultimate experience in nerd rage.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Enhanced Visuals!
  .
  Experience the 8-bit ugliness in a whole new way.
  .
  Updated Game Engine!
  .
  And by updated, we mean "Rebuilt the first game from the ground up in the
  superior second game's engine." Trust us, it feels better.
  .
  Improved level design and difficulty options!
  .
  Both games are infamously hard-as-nails, but Normal and Easy difficulties come
  with infinite lives, so take as many attempts as you need to beat the challenge.
  Level designs have been improved upon to really nail the balance between tough
  and fair. Or perhaps you loved the limited lives and ludicrous overuse of
  instant-death blocks in the original release? We've got you covered. Just select
  "Old School" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the
  developers' name in no time.
  .
  Quality of Life Improvements!
  .
  Faster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back
  out of the Toaster and get on with your day, just like nature intended!),
  multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take
  on the challenge.
  .
  New Chapter, Completing The Story!
  .
  "Wait, the game had a story" You ask? To which we say: ...Kinda! But there's
  more of it now! Beat both games to unlock the epic finale!
  .
  And more!

  Reception
  .
  "Scenic water stretches and skyward spangles decorate idyllic countryside
  villages and moody, rain-drizzled night scenes. This is another one of those
  games I've flicked through the screenshots as if it were a global travel book
  outlining places you should visit before you die." - Chris Priestman, Indie
  Statik
  .
  "The game's sound design is the strongest facilitator of Anodyne's sense of
  dread and unease; the ambience and music give off an air of suspicion and
  danger, with ugly chords and disquieting, unnatural-sounding synthetic pings. It
  all adds up to a game where you're not sure who to trust, and you can't be sure
  of what's real." - Sam Prell, Penny Arcade Report
  .
  Please Note
  .
  The Mac version has flickering on fullscreen on some version of Mac OSX. Please
  play in windowed mode.
  .
  Linux: Anodyne does not have an official Linux version, buy at your own risk -
  This is unsupported, a very old (but complete) version from 2013 or so. I cannot
  help you with any bugs for this version. You can try to get the executable
  working, or you can play the standalone SWF.
  .
  Content Warnings (Light spoilers)
  .
  Low-res pixel art (like in the style of the screenshots of): Suicide by hanging,
  mild horror, murder by blunt objects, dead bodies, stabbing, blood stains,
  mentions of sex, unexpected killing of an NPC. Rare strong language. Note this
  isn't representative of the majority of the game, but it is unavoidable.
  .
  Content Warnings (Spoilers)
  .
  Early on, if you try to talk to a fisherman, when trying to talk, you will
  unexpectedly hit them into the ocean and it turns the water red. They're implied
  to die.
  .
  In the late-game black/white suburb area: suicide by hanging, murder by blunt
  objects, stabbing, blood stains, dead bodies, mild horror
  .
  In the late-game 8-bit pixel art maze: blood stains, dead bodies
  .
  In the late-game circus area: mentions of suicide, suicide by falling into a
  pit, dead bodies, blood stains
  .
  In the very-late-game golden garden area: mentions of sex
  .
  Throughout: rare strong language

game: Anomalies (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/A/Anomalies (USA)/Anomalies (USA).json
developer: Schmidt Workshops
publisher: Schmidt Workshops
genre: Simulation
description:
  Anomalies may be a game, then again it may not. One user described it as "A
  million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain."
  .
  Another said "I don't even know what to say about this one. It honestly freaked
  me out a little."
  .
  A particularly enthusiastic user stated "Wish I had some kind of supercomputer
  to push the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets
  of the universe."
  .
  A Fine Art Game
  .
  Anomalies is an experimental generative art game. There are no levels, points or
  objectives. It is a "game" in the loosest sense of being an amusement or
  pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can
  tinker around with and explore.
  .
  Generate and Explore
  .
  You can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can change the anomaly's
  parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your
  creation. Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique sights and
  sounds they generate.
  .
  Sights and Sounds
  .
  Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one
  effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are
  symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and "songs" you hear in the demo
  video were produced through the program's algorithms.
  .
  Other Options
  .
  Using a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your
  handiwork. Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you
  want to revisit a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again
  later. There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies
  automatically, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show.
  .
  Experimental
  .
  I call Anomalies "experimental" because of the way in which I developed it. I
  started with a simple idea - "what would trees look like if they grew in space?"
  - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures. Once that was
  working, I thought about different colors and textures. Each stage brought new
  questions and possibilities - "what if they move or wiggle? What it they make
  sounds? What if they produce flames or particles?" - and so on, until I arrived
  at what you see in the program. So I had no idea what it would end up like when
  I started it. Though I have moved on to other projects, I still think about more
  possibilities for Anomalies. I do hope to be able to return to working on this
  program at some point, but I will not give any promises right now...
  .
  Moddable Anomalies
  .
  If you want to change things around, add your own sound effects, swap out
  textures etc... download the "Anomalies_Moddable.zip" and have at it!
  .
  For Backgrounds, the game looks at the following files:
  .
  Space_Background_006.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_007.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_008.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_009.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_010.bmp
  .
  There are a few other background styles in there already.  If you rename them to
  one of these (6-10) then they will appear in-game, if the background slider is
  set to the appropriate number.  For whatever reason, 0 and 1 both correspond to
  "Space_Background_006.bmp", 2 to 007, 3 to 008, 4 to 009 and 5 to 010.  It's not
  particularly logical, but it works :)

  Another Hero is a pencil and paper role playing game for three players where you
  can take turns as unstoppable Heroes, powerful Villains, and the rest of the
  World and people that help the story unfold.
  .
  Each Hero acts to fulfill their Destiny, gifted with Resolve by a powerful being
  that allows them to make ceaseless progress towards their goal. On the way, they
  will need to navigate through Conflicts, bargaining with a combination of
  objects imbued with their power and the circumstances of the situation. Every
  action they take has the potential to not just advance them towards their
  Destiny, but to open them up to the Plague buried within. Should they fall fully
  to the Plague, they become a monster in their own right, a fitting Villain for
  another Hero's tale.
  .
  The game seeks to capture the feeling of roleplaying videogames where you can
  always reload a save and just keep on pressing ahead. It's not a game about
  winning or losing - it's about telling the story of a Hero and seeing what
  unfolds on the way. The rules are designed not to be gamed or carefully followed
  for maximum points, but instead to facilitate the progression of the story.
  .
  Will your Hero reach their goal? Will they give up hope and return to mortality?
  Or will they be corrupted by the Plague that festers within? The story is not
  yet told - it's up to you to play it out. Welcome to the worlds of Another Hero.

  Major features:
  .
  Diceless play
  .
  Rules for Hero, Enemy, and Worldly Characters

  This game can be played either with a keyboard or a game controller! There can

  [X] or (A) to use the laser-beam

  [C] or (B) to use the bomb

  Additionally, here's a little tip: after selecting a level, and after you've
  unlocked some upgrades, you can select unlocked upgrades by pressing down
  instead of confirming the [restore file] prompt. We're sorry we didn't manage to
  communicate this better in-game, we'll do better next time!

  Claim a Better Future!
  .
  In a ruined and terraformed world where most of humanity is under the yoke of a
  brutal regime, the former workers of a once-remote factory - now known as The
  Collective - have risen up to create a future of freedom from oppression. You
  are an Ace - a highly skilled pilot referred from a Division in The Collective
  and assigned a humanoid combat vehicle known as a Frame. You and your Strike
  Team of fellow Aces must take on The Collective's greatest threats, ensure its
  survival, and carve a path for its continued success.
  .
  Frenetic action: Light, Medium, and Heavy Frames clash on the post-apocalyptic
  battlefield in a combat system based on LUMEN. Your Strike Team is ready and
  capable of carving through armies of enemies to fight for the Collective.
  .
  Customizable Mechs: The simplicity of the basic rules combines with a robust tag
  system and light resource management to provide any level of depth you might
  want. Extremely fast character creation and pre-assembled loadouts make it very
  simple to get started. Once a player has a grasp of the system, 9 Frames with
  unique traits and abilities combine with 18 Armaments and 18 Systems to allow
  players to customize as little or as much as they want. As time goes on, new
  tags can be added to any equipment, allowing players to mold any loadout to
  their exact specifications.
  .
  Varied Threats: Several enemy types and factions allow for a lot of flexibility
  in creating encounters. Face off against the iron-fisted Republic, the cunning
  Claw, or crafty Survivalists. Plow through Standard enemies, clash with more
  dangerous Prime enemies, or face a sprawling Colossus enemy - a multi-part
  monstrosity that can be a mission unto itself!
  .
  Session and Campaign Play: The game is satisfying when played as a one-shot, but
  it also supports lengthy campaigns. Tools for shaping the setting to players'
  preferences, providing mission choices, and pacing different kinds of sessions
  over time, as well as two different kinds of player advancement, are provided
  help keep things interesting for everyone for many sessions to come. APOCALYPSE
  FRAME is also built for inclusion of outside material during play: its campaign
  loop contains explicit on-ramps for expansion, third-party, or homebrew content
  to be introduced mid-campaign.
  .
  Advanced Rules: This release also provides Advanced Rules that are intended to
  raise the stakes for players who are familiar with the system and want more to
  sink their teeth into. This includes more options for both players and GMs to
  expand the depth of the system at any pace.
  .
  Out Of Development: Featuring gameplay finely tuned by a year and a half of
  development, a new layout, a manuscript edited by Marx Shepherd, and art by
  Galen Pejeau and Mykell Pledger!

  Influences
  .
  I was most influenced by:
  .
  LUMEN/LIGHT, clearly!
  .
  Xenoblade Chronicles X (parts of it, anyhow) had a ton of influence on the
  concept and prospective missions and enemies.
  .
  Armored Core was an inspiration for the speed of play and modularity of Frames,
  as well as the moment-to-moment feel in general.
  .
  Battletech gave me the idea of using hexes and lent some inspiration for how
  initial/canonical Frame loadouts are laid out.
  .
  XCOM was an unexpected and unintentional (but ultimately welcome) influence for
  campaign flow.
  .
  Other content available
  .
  Ballad of Industrial Gods, an expansive mission, is out now! You can check that
  out here!
  .
  The Infected World, a 4-part season of content about exploration and dealing
  with other people, has concluded and is available here!
  .
  Licenses
  .
  This game is Illuminated by LUMEN, based on the LUMEN RPG system designed by
  Spencer Campbell, Gila RPGs. This game is in no way affiliated with Spencer
  Campbell or Gila RPGs.

  .
  Since a second edition is coming, please check out the first edition for free!
  .
  ------------
  .
  In Apotheosis, 2-5 players will explore the relationship between a culture's
  history and their dominant cultural story as they create and change a legend
  over the course of generations.
  .
  Your goal as players is to tell an interesting story about the culture you'll
  develop, and to tell their dominant story in turn. You'll be telling this story
  collaboratively: each player will be roleplaying as an abstraction of the
  culture, not as specific characters.
  .
  You'll create and develop the basics of the culture together, seed their
  original dominant legend, and then watch that legend change as major historical
  events occur. This is a game about the relationship between what a culture
  experiences, and how they represent that in the stories they tell each other.

  Explore the ruins of the human race and discover the thriving wildlife that

  extinction.
  .
  The water rose by an unpredictable amount due to climate change. The sun started
  losing power and the Earth's surface froze over. Humans were forced to live
  underwater, where they could still harvest energy and grow food, changing how
  cities and districts looked. As resources began to dwindle in the year 2971,
  sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable
  planets. Things did not go as planned, as the ship, Argo9, returns millions of
  years later in a time humans have gone extinct.
  .
  It will be up to the player to determine if the ruins of our species is a
  travesty or an inevitable conclusion as they explore the waters and encounter
  deadly underwater monsters.
  .
  Controls: movement WASD || shooting/aim = LMB/mouse || Change weapon =
  Scroll/"Q" & "E"/Numb keys or you can use a gamepad (xbox controller
  recommended).
  .
  So this is our first big game! We haven't made a big game before so it's really
  exciting to make something of this scale, but also a bit like just being two
  people wrestling a colossus. Much like in Shadow of the Colossus. This is
  something we really want to make as great as possible so we're taking our time
  and working loads on it, full time like.

  A collection of games I wrote over the years in Java with their full sources.
  Some are rather complex games, and I tried to complete them to a playable state
  (Sea Wars being the most complex), some simpler (Similar, my 2nd applet game
  from 2006).
  .
  SeaWars is a relatively complete 2D strategic game that play on maps: a global
  strategic map and a zoomed tactical map. On the strategic map you play as you
  want, with only events that you can avoid without penalties (in this version).
  But you don't see the enemies, or your civil ships. On the tactical map you
  fight. You see the enemies only if they are damaged, otherwise you need to
  detect them. If too far you might not know if they are in your camp or not.
  .
  It's a simple game on some aspects, but complex on some others. For instance
  missiles and torpedoes can follow waypoints then seek for a target.
  .
  It became a bit too much for one person, so I finally "fixed" the gameplay this
  year, adding full save, separation of surface units and submarine (by default
  you will command surface unit, but you can manually decide), addition of civil
  unit and many small changes and fixes.
  .
  And it would be the ideal game to mod, complement, or use as a base for other
  game: use some algorithms or ideas within another game.
  .
  Draw was SeaWars. I accidentally discovered that the tactical map of Sea Wars
  could do very cool effects. Draw was born. The engine below is the same, the
  elements you see are still missiles and torpedoes, and they think they are in a
  naval game :). It's the most polished "game" here, and was finished around 2009,
  with only additions since then, and an automatic throttle system: the number of
  elements allowed changes depending on the FPS. But it's also one with many parts
  remaining from SeaWars. I kept them "in case". One of the latest addition was to
  reintegrate a SeaWars mechanism...
  .
  Similar is the oldest game. Based on a Palm Pilot game (for whose old enough to
  remember), it was aimed at being a very light online game. And it is. Using pure
  Java graphics systems, it is also suffering for that. It is still enjoyable, and
  had some good success when it was on the web (>10.000 players), but would
  greatly benefit from a remake. The score are not saved anymore, as I chose to
  keep the ghost code that was saving in a distant MySQL server (
  DBSupport.addScore(playerName.toString(), score, nbColors, sizeGrid); ). Feel
  free to add a local DB support, or a modern score system. I will add any change
  to the code!
  .
  All my code is released under MIT licence, so you are free to do whatever you
  want with it. The games are mostly easy to change, up to a point - some parts
  might not be so simple - so can be modified by children, with a little help.
  Feel free to share new creations or modifications. If you contact me I will be
  happy to share them as part of the pack here!
  .
  All the games were originally Applets, so POJO without many dependencies. They
  can be compiled and run within Eclipse or another IDE very easily.
  .
  The current pack is ready to run on Windows, but it should be relatively easy to
  run on Linux. If you can do a distribution for it simply contact me. I will help
  you do that and give you a free key.  A Mac version is on the work but could
  benefit from some help too!
  .
  All good modifications can be shared within the pack with the authors credited!
  Just be careful if you use API or assets for their respective licences. Be
  careful that GPL APIs cannot be used as this project is under a MIT licence,
  which allows commercial use without sharing source. LGPL APIs can be used if
  used as libs only (not part of the project's sources).
  .
  You can also fetch the code from the public repository: archive on BitBucket
  .
  Buying this pack will support creating more content such as that!
  .
  If you encounter any issue, please contact me. If you are a developer, feel free
  to look at the code! I will credit anybody that helps! :)

description:
  You are an assistant curator of the natural history museum in the city where you
  live. It's a comfortable life; your antiquities department is well-funded and
  you have staffed it with hard-working people that you trust. Today, a new
  donation has arrived. The crate has no return address, and when you open it, it
  contains only one strange artifact nestled in packing material, and no other
  information.
  .
  The artifact is mysterious - you feel uneasy keeping it in your office, but
  don't want to store it anywhere until you figure out a bit more about it.
  .
  Strange things start to happen soon after you acquire this artifact, and you
  begin to have vivid disturbing dreams. You quickly realize that something is
  using this item to try and push its way through into your reality, and the
  strain is tearing at your physical and mental health.
  .
  Can you convince others that this threat is real before some otherworldly terror
  is loosed on the world? As your dreams and waking mind are corrupted by its
  influence, can you stave off madness long enough to find a way to destroy this
  accursed artifact?
  .
  You don't know, but the consequences of failure are too terrible not to try.

  doctor no one tries to stop him
  .
  Jude Myers

  .
  family he has left. Or in the greenhouse tending to the plants with loud

  .
  tech, you should probably assume it's contraband and say nothing
  .
  Gloria Miller

  feel bad that she didn't let you win.

  .
  Changelog
  .
  v1.4 update:
  .
  I made several small changes in this update, but a couple of important ones as
  well. Most importantly, I added a rule clarification that came up in a recent
  play session. I've also added information about licensing your own As the Crow
  Flies content, gave express permission for teachers to use the game in the
  classroom, and added a game mode for collaborative play. I've also updated the
  TXT file to v1.4, since I added new text to the game.
  .
  Repositioned the Credits & Acknowledgments and Table of Contents pages.
  .
  Added permission for teachers to print and distribute the game to their
  students.
  .
  Licensed As the Crow Flies under the Creative Commons 4.0 International license,
  allowing creators to make content for the game.
  .
  Changed the card art in the example card layout.
  .
  Added the following to the Gameplay section under Exploration;
  .
  "Moving to a card you've already explored does not cost any Feather Tokens".
  .
  Added Collaborative Play to the Alternate Gameplay Options section.
  .
  Removed the Baby Crow art from the Alternative Gameplay Options section;
  replaced it with a sample "Smaller Board" visual.
  .
  Replaced the old Chubby Crow Games logo on the back cover with the new one.
  .
  Added a QR code to the back cover that takes users to the As the Crow Flies itch
  page.
  .
  Updated Plain Text version with all of the changes above, except for art and
  layout changes.
  .
  v1.3 update:
  .
  I updated the working file from being a google document to an affinity publisher
  document, making it easier for me to work with and update as well as export
  different file types. No meaningful changes were made to the text of the game,
  save for formatting when needed, so the .TXT file is exactly the same as v1.2.
  .
  v1.2 update:
  .
  Balanced Spade Card Prompts to reduce probability of bad luck leading to a short
  game
  .
  Removed Spade card prompts that caused you to lose Feather Tokens, and replaced
  them with prompts that cause you to gain a Feather Token instead.

  Asteroids... But Roguelite is a game about shooting enemy ships and (you guessed
  it) asteroids in order to increase your score. Your multiplier grows as you kill
  enemies and resets when you get hit. Visit the store after bosses in order to
  upgrade your ship and score higher.   Try to get a build going that can survive
  long enough to rack up a large multiplier in order to take your place on the
  leaderboard!
  .
  In between rounds, you can purchase various upgrades from the shop of which
  there are currently over 40 of.  You can also spend money on rolling different
  quests to undertake. Some quests just give you a bonus for defeating a set
  amount of enemies, some actually upgrade your abilities themselves. For example,
  there's a quest for killing 50 enemies with your laser to unlock a double laser.
  .
  And that's it!  Blow up enemies and asteroids, use your money to increase your
  power, and aim for a spot on the leaderboard.  Once you die, your run is over
  and you can start again.
  .
  I made this game in a little under four months. It's not my life's work, but I
  think it has a good amount of content for it's price point. I want to be clear
  with setting expectations that this isn't a 100 hour game, and it's priced
  accordingly. What you get is a high-score chasing shoot-em-up with multiple
  upgrade paths and quests to complete.  I've added a video of me playing for
  under 5 minute and defeating on of the randomized bosses.

description:
  Play as Doctor Simon Forman - unlicensed medical professional and astrologer -
  and help him win a medical licence. Astrologaster is a narrative-based comedy
  game.
  .
  Explore Forman's life, his work, and his relationships with his clients. Make
  story choices by performing astrological readings. Choose strategically or make
  decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences
  (and unpredictable side effects!)
  .
  13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional
  and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and
  determine answers for your clients' problems. As well as affecting the
  storyline, these choices will alter your clients' satisfaction levels. Satisfied
  clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these
  letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge.
  .
  So-called real (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman
  prove these medical establishment elitists wrong!
  .
  Features
  .
  Perform real* astrology: Examine the sky and choose astrological interpretations
  that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an
  exact science!)
  .
  Solve hilarious problems: Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror
  plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies!
  .
  Change lives: Win your patients' favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14
  characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which
  often overlap with each other. Use gossip from some characters to guide and
  manipulate others.
  .
  Win a medical licence: Convince patients to write letters of recommendations.
  Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical licence.
  .
  Fully voiced character dialogue: Sitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast
  of over a dozen actors.
  .
  Sing along: Enjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character's theme
  song.
  .
  Casebooks come alive: Simon Forman's cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up
  book. Turn pages to delve deeper into your patients' stories.
  .
  The Story
  .
  London, 1592. A great plague sweeps through the capital. When doctors flee the
  city in fear, a hero rises. His name is Simon Forman, "Doctor" of Astrology,
  Astronomy and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can
  find their lost pets and predict their futures! All by reading the movements of
  the stars.
  .
  But when the plague ends, Forman's problems begin. The real doctors return to
  London and they will stop at nothing to bring him down...
  .
  Summary
  .
  Astrologaster is a story-driven astrological comedy game set in Shakespeare's
  London. Based on a true - and truly ridiculous - story. Simon Forman was
  considered a sage by some and a charlatan by others. What will your legacy be?
  Will you put your faith in the stars?

  You and your companions have traveled across long distances and faced many

  person who can grant you what you need. Now you stand at the gate to the

  Prologue
  .
  Yesterday we tracked the Rhaokyn battleship Kreegynn entering Bravo quadrant.
  They attacked and overtook the Hyperion-Six station, seizing the atomic impulse
  core. It is of utmost importance we do not let that core get to Rhaokyn hands.
  Your objective is to grab the core and get out before they can lock down the
  station.
  .
  Backstory
  .
  It has been nearly six years since the end of the Delotian wars. Our first
  war...our first contact, with an alien race. We thought the Delotians were
  coming to annihilate us. We later learned they were running away from the real
  threat. For eighteen generations the Delotians were hunted by the Rhaokyns.
  Everything they knew, everything they were had been lost or destroyed. The
  Delotians travelled through subspace to remote parts of the galaxy to hide from
  their hunters. Luck brought them to our backyard. They wanted help. They needed
  help. We didn't listen.
  .
  But that war is over. We are stitching together what threads of friendship we
  can. The Rhaokyns have found them again and now they have found us.

  Welcome to a world trapped in perpetual fighting. Attrition is a turn-based
  strategy game where three countries, Lutem, Bertas, and Cualitas, are constantly
  at war with one-another. Command their armies in a story of opposite opinions,
  sacrifices for one's beliefs, and the quest for a greater goal. Here no one's
  completely in the wrong, but no one's completely in the right.
  .
  In the world of Attrition armies are simple, consisting only of troops armed
  with obsolete rifles, and not always having the capacity to move around with
  ease. A pair of dice controls how far an army can go, so commanders must adjust
  to every situation and get the most out of the terrain they're fighting in. Here
  the lucky have the advantage, but the better strategist comes out victorious.

genre: Card Game
description:
  Aurora is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players. This game is deliberately
  designed to be played comfortably while practicing social distancing or together
  around a communal table when the necessity for distancing has ceased.
  .
  Your story is built and told in three modular phases:
  .
  1. Crafting a unique deck of Oracle cards through the mail, using your friends
  zipcodes to randomize prompts and elements of your illustrations. Phase I is
  available as a free demo as part of the Step Up for the Postal Service game jam.
  .
  2. Using those cards to build a flawed City corrupted by Darkness and populate
  it with hopeful citizens who aspire to overcome those flaws with Light.
  .
  3. Acting out the story of the overcoming of darkness in favor of light, using
  your characters and cards from prior phases to bring hope and revolution to your
  world.
  .
  To play, you need a few friends, some paper or note cards to write and draw on,
  and a method to communicate.
  .
  Aurora is available as a high quality printed zine at worldchampgame.co/store.
  This game was made possible by supporters at patreon.com/worldchampgameco in May
  2020.
  .
  UPDATE April 2021: Since many of us are receiving our vaccines and hopefully
  will be able to return to in-person play, I made a free deck you can use to skip
  or supplant Phase I! It is listed as a free demo here so you can use the cards
  even if you haven't bought the game yet or if you just got the zine at my store.
  Available as a two-sided print PDF and as individual card PNGs for uploading to
  Roll20 or other virtual tabletops.

  growth of the player. Not the one in the game, but the one in the chair.

  some might be challenging, some might be interesting prototypes that could
  become larger games. More games are added each month so keep us installed and

  It is the far future. Earth has been abandoned for generations. Humanity left
  for brighter stars, richer planets and shining colonies. To fuel their dreams of
  a better tomorrow, the humans turned to the Elementals and their magic. This
  magic is an invaluable source of power and labor. Machines were created to
  harness and enslave the Elementals .
  .
  You were one of these Enslaved Elementals. You are machines that echo the
  legendary magic you once possessed. You and your friends are among the few who
  have managed to return to Earth. What remains of Earth's cities is falling
  apart. The Corp won't let go of you so easily either. But shining through the
  cracks is a magic that is ready to be reborn.
  .
  Can you outrun The Corp long enough and bring forth the Rebirth of magic? Will
  you survive this revolution you've started, or will The Corp recapture you? We
  play the game of BALIKBAYAN: RETURNING HOME to find out.
  .
  BALIKBAYAN is great for veterans ready for a more narrative experience, and
  perfect for people new to the hobby. Bring your dystopic post-Cyberpunk
  fantasies to life, revel in supernatural Filipino folklore, and dance along the
  threads between magic and technology.
  .
  Run the game how you like it: with or without a Game Moderator!
  .
  Based on the Belonging Outside Belonging System (Dream Askew, Dream Apart, and
  many other beautiful games)
  .
  Ticking clock mechanic: can you bring about the rebirth of magic before the corp
  enslaves you again?
  .
  Token based economy: no dice, no masters.
  .
  Strong Cyberpunk-Supernatural-Folklore aesthetic and themes
  .
  Magic and Technology meet beautifully in an evocative way
  .
  Based on Filipino myths and legends, but you do not have to be Filipino to play
  this game or enjoy/understand its themes
  .
  By supporting this game now, you will help support the game and receive future
  versions for free.

  Out Now On:
  .
  Xbox| Switch| PlayStation| Steam
  .
  Congratulations!
  .
  You and your friends are graduating from the prestigious Intergalactic Time
  Academy. No time for partying though as your first mission awaits! The Orbees
  are all missing. Yes, those curious little beings made of energy who power our
  time-tech are nowhere to be fou... no, wait! We have a faint trace on their
  signal. Are you brave enough to rescue them?
  .
  Prepare yourself for unknown dangers. If you find some of the Orbees they might
  equip your Space-Time Machine with new tech. Decide who is in charge of each
  gadget and combine your abilities to discover the best strategies.
  .
  Use cunning, comradeship and co-operation to survive and never forget the
  Academy motto: "BFF or Die!"
  .
  Best Friends Forever
  .
  BFF or Die is a game for you if:
  .
  You want a 2-4 player game to play with your partner/family/friends where you
  get to do everything as a team.
  .
  Pure co-operation sounds fun to you as it's a different feeling when you all
  work together.
  .
  You like games that are easy to start playing but then gradually get more
  challenging.
  .
  You like games that let you figure things out yourself rather than "hand
  holding" you too much and telling you what to do.
  .
  You want a game with a fun, short campaign mode which adds replayability by
  having difficult trophies to collect and also an unlockable "Infinite" mode.
  .
  Is There Online Multiplayer?
  .
  We do not have native online multiplayer support... BUT... you *can* play with
  your friends online by using Parsec. Parsec (which is free to use) lets you
  share games with friends by streaming your screen and sound to them. Their
  inputs (control pad or keyboard commands) then get sent to you and with almost
  no lag (depending on your computer and internet). This let's you play real-time
  online co-op together..!
  .
  What to Expect
  .
  We strongly recommend playing in co-op 2, 3 or 4 player mode as this is when the
  game is most fun. Playtime will vary depending on your skill level but as a
  guide:
  .
  1-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  2-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  3-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  4-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  "The Infinite Trials": 1-999 hours! Or maybe  hours :) Complete as many
  randomised/procedural levels in a row as you can without losing. Go back to the
  start if you die.
  .
  You can either share controllers (two people per controller) or have separate
  controllers. As a minimum you need the keyboard and one control pad to have a
  4-player game. Or you can use four separate control pads, it's up to you.
  .
  There's a story mode with 30 levels followed by an unlockable "Infinite Trials"
  mode with challenging randomised/procedural levels.
  .
  Is Your Computer Fast Enough?
  .
  If you have a dedicated graphics card and/or your computer can normally play 3D
  games then you should be able to run BFF or Die just fine.
  .
  If you have a high resolution screen (like with newer Macbooks) then you will
  probably want to set the bootup options of the game to 1920x1080 to get a smooth
  frame rate unless you also have a super fast graphics card to match your high
  screen resolution.
  .
  Info for Mac Users
  .
  Please note that because of changes Apple have made, the game won't launch on
  Mac OS Catalina and above.
  .
  New Game
  .
  Hey, Shaz here, the game designer - I'm working on a new co-op game called Co
  OPERATION. You can see more info on the Itch page..!

description:
  In Back to Bed you guide the sleepwalker Bob to the safety of his bed by taking
  control of his subconscious guardian named Subob. Together they will travel
  through a surreal and painting-like dream world, avoiding dangers and getting
  safely back to bed.
  .
  Back to Bed is an artistic 3D puzzle game with a surreal twist. It tells the
  story of Bob, an unlucky narcoleptic who has a tendency of falling asleep in his
  boring office and then proceeding to sleepwalk into the dangers of the big city.
  Luckily, Bob has a subconscious guardian named Subob, whom spawns from the mind
  of Bob and whose job it is to protect the sleepwalker from any danger and guide
  him back to the safety of his bed.
  .
  The ever vigilant Subob must guide the constantly sleepwalking Bob on a journey
  through a series of surreal painting-like cityscapes where the boundary between
  Bob's dreams and reality have vanished, as Subob is part of Bob's
  subconsciousness. The result is an artistic dream world that is recognizable,
  yet totally different from the real world, where many things are not what they
  seem and dangers to the sleepwalker lurks deeper in. Key features
  .
  Unique surreal and artistic game universe
  .
  A strange but beautiful dream universe that mixes elements from the real world
  and the world of dreams to create something unique, surreal and sometimes a bit
  scary.
  .
  Isometric puzzle levels
  .
  Navigate detailed 3D puzzles that defy the laws of physics, wherein the player
  must manipulate the strange environment to create a safe path for Bob and avoid
  the dangers of the puzzle.
  .
  Two characters as one
  .
  Play as the embodied subconsciousness, in the form of a small guardian creature,
  trying to save its own sleepwalking body from dangers of the the dream world.
  .
  Picturesque visual style
  .
  Discover the feeling of playing in a piece of art set in a digital frame. A
  visual style inspired by hand-painted techniques, surreal art and impossible
  shapes.
  .
  Nightmare mode
  .
  Unlock a hard mode of the game, made for those who truly want to test their
  puzzle solving skills and enjoy thinking many steps ahead, or who are just too
  stubborn to give up.
  .
  Best played with controller
  .
  Back to Bed is best played with a controller, but fear not, if you do not
  possess one, mouse can still be used.

game: Backbone (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/B/Backbone (USA)/Backbone (USA).json
developer: Raw Fury
publisher: Raw Fury
genre: Puzzle
description:
  You're not special. You're not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances,
  you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your
  biggest case yet.
  .
  There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.
  .
  Backbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard
  Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a
  deeply personal story of change and transformation.
  .
  Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern
  political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of
  Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and
  challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.
  .
  Backbone's gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression,
  featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as
  exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but
  defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.
  .
  As Howard, you will:
  .
  Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of
  truth
  .
  Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of
  person you want to be
  .
  Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange,
  yet familiar version of Vancouver
  .
  Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss
  .
  Be a raccoon
  .
  Post-noir dystopia
  .
  Backbone's Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely
  without hope. It's a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with
  genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference.
  Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.
  .
  Stunning visuals
  .
  The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like
  dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the
  sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville
  and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic
  animals.
  .
  Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack
  .
  Original doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative
  combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone's OST is expertly
  crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape
  that serves and enhances storytelling.
  .
  Mature content
  .
  Backbone heavily features strong language, themes of violence, systemic racism
  and sexism, drug abuse, depression, terminal illness, body horror, death. All
  imagery is suggestive and not direct, but we would still never recommend this
  game to children.

developer: Basically Games
publisher: Basically Games
genre: Edutainment;Horror
description:
  Baldi's Basics Plus version 0.3 has just released!
  .
  Check below for more info on the current state of the game!
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus is like the original game, but PLUS! The same cruddy
  edutainment horror type parody theme is back, but with hugely expanded gameplay
  features, including procedurally generated levels, field trip minigames, crazy
  random events, PLUS more characters, more items, and more chaos!
  .
  This game is not what it seems...
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus is a survival horror roguelite that parodies cheap 90's
  edutainment and never takes itself too seriously. You will encounter strange
  characters, find useful items, go on field trips and more as you explore Baldi's
  ever changing super schoolhouse, and as you explore the game itself, you'll
  start to realize it is not what it seems...
  .
  So, what exactly do you do in this game? You collect notebooks while playing
  hide and seek with Baldi! Sounds easy right? Wrong. Baldi can hear many of your
  actions, and he uses those sounds to try and find you. He's also invited many
  friends to come and play, who can cause a lot of trouble. Get to know them
  though and you can use them to your advantage! You'll also find lots of items
  scattered around the school. These are the key to success. Use them wisely if
  you want to have a chance at beating Baldi!
  .
  Near infinite replayability
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus randomizes so many different things, every time you play
  will be a different experience!
  .
  Procedurally generated levels - The levels change every time you play! Not only
  will the layout change, but the types of rooms and obstacles, you find will
  change too!
  .
  Random events - One moment everything is fine, the next the school is flooding,
  or fills with fog! Random events can begin at any moment, so make sure you're
  ready for them!
  .
  Mixing and matching characters - Each time you play, you'll get to see random
  combination of characters.
  .
  All these variables add up to make each playthrough a unique experience!
  .
  Lots of ways to play
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus features many different modes to test players in different
  ways!
  .
  Main Mode - Complete a series of randomly generated levels to win! Run out of
  lives and you'll have to start over.
  .
  Endless Mode - See how many notebooks you can collect before being caught by
  Baldi! Compete by playing on pre-made levels, or go crazy and try playing on a
  randomly generated one.
  .
  Challenge Mode - As you play more of the Main Mode, you'll unlock challenges!
  Challenges offer unique scenarios you won't find in the main game. One might
  have you sneaking around the school to avoid being seen by the Principal of the

  Field Trips Mode - Play field trips found in the main game whenever you like!
  You can try to set high scores, or just practice!
  .
  Early access info
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus is going to launch this spring as an early access title.
  This means you will be able to buy and play the game, but it won't be finished
  yet! As such you can expect to encounter some bugs, and there will be some
  missing features for a while. However, you will also receive all future updates
  for free and get to be a part of this game's development! Check out the FAQ
  below for more info.
  .
  Why Early Access?
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus has become a much longer project than I initially
  anticipated (That's game development for you!). However, I feel like it has
  reached a very playable and enjoyable state, so instead of making everyone wait
  who knows how long to be able to play, I've decided to release the game in early
  access so everyone can enjoy it sooner and take part in the development process!
  .
  Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
  .
  Currently, I'm thinking the game will probably be in development for another
  year or two until it reaches a state where I could call it finished.
  .
  How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
  .
  The full version will differ mainly by having more content. More NPCs, more
  random events, more items, more level styles, more everything! Of course, the
  full version won't just be the early access with more content. As the game
  develops there will be lots of polishing, QoL improvements, new major features
  added, etc. Perhaps most importantly, adjustments to game balance will mostly be
  done when the early access is coming to a close. The full version will also
  include some secrets and story elements that will not be found in the early
  access versions.
  .
  What is the current state of the Early Access version?
  .
  Keep an eye on this list as development progresses to see what's being added!
  .
  Features that are currently implemented include:
  .
  Hide and Seek (The game's main mode), which requires the player to beat a series
  of randomly generated levels. (Currently has three levels to beat, more are
  planned)
  .
  Challenge Mode (Currently there are three challenge maps, more are planned)
  .
  Endless Mode
  .
  Field trip Mode
  .
  Custom NPC AI (Currently there are 12 fully functional NPCs, more are planned)
  .
  Procedural level generation
  .
  Random events (Currently there are seven, more are planned)
  .
  Field trips (Currently there are two, more are planned)
  .
  "Educational" activities, which are very short puzzles or mini-games that must
  be completed to collect notebooks in some modes (Currently there is one, more
  are planned).
  .
  Custom lighting system
  .
  In-game shop where you can purchase items between levels
  .
  Save and continue system, which will allow you to quit in the middle of a game
  of Hide and Seek and then continue later where you left off
  .
  Planned features that are not yet implemented include:
  .
  Secret levels
  .
  In-game achievement system.
  .
  Horror elements (This will come much later into development. Currently the game
  has very little in the way of spooks)
  .
  Crappy "edutainment" elements, including things like more interactive menus
  (Where you can click on things!) and other common edutainment game tropes.
  .
  Adaptive music
  .
  Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
  .
  Yes, as the game develops and more content is added, the price will increase
  accordingly. Of course, anyone who has already purchased the game will continue
  to receive all updates for free, even after price increases.
  .
  How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
  .
  Feedback is crucial to the development of this insane game! I will mainly use
  community feedback for fixing bugs, as well as balancing and quality of life
  improvements.

  Balloonys girlfriend got swept away by a strong gust of wind. Travel through 80

  Gameplay is inspired by the game Bubble Ghost, an old favourite of mine and
  although fans of Bubble ghost will see that gameplay is very different at the
  same time there is not much else to compare Balloonys adventure to.
  .
  Left click anywhere on the screen and Balloony will turn to face that direction,
  then Right click and he will fly off in the selected direction bouncing off of
  walls and generally being hard to control. Watch out for spikes, lava and other
  miscellaneous traps as you bounce your way through eighty screens of balloon
  popping mayhem.

developer: onemrbean
publisher: onemrbean
genre: Sports
description:
  BasketBelle is an experimental 2D basketball-based platformer. Each Chapter of
  the game uses the mechanics and idea of basketball in a different way. At one
  point you might be dribbling inside the intestines of a purple blob creature. At
  others, you're likely to be dunking above the clouds in front of the Parisian
  moon.
  .
  A dynamic soundtrack and unique cardboard visuals help tell the story of a
  sister who must be saved through the power of basketball.
  .
  Dunk, dribble, and crossover through 8 Chapters spanning throughout the
  impromptu courts of Paris
  .
  Each Chapter takes the mechanics of basketball and applies them in different
  ways. Some chapters are more action, some are more puzzle. And then there are
  the strange chapters.
  .
  Music is tied directly to the gameplay, though it's all passively controlled.
  For example, every time you dribble, you hear a bass hit. Shoot the ball, and
  the percussion stops.
  .
  Visuals in the game are a unique mix of cardboard and color, every scene popping
  off the screen.
  .
  Included with the game! :D
  .
  The BasketBelle EP: Full Soundtrack + Bonus Tracks (MP3) + Cover Art

  BasketBelle sketchbook: Full-color PDF including sketches and liner notes

developer: John Vanderhoef
publisher: John Vanderhoef
genre: Shooter
description:
  Bat Lizard Bonanza is an arcade shoot-em-up (or shmup) for the NES. It's
  inspired by games like Gradius and Parodius.
  .
  The settlers have been exploiting Irata's natural resources for many solar
  cycles. The Wampus took back the mountains. The Wart Worms took back the mines.
  But now Lizzy the Bat Lizard must embark on a quest to end the Settler scourge
  once and for all, dauntless in the wind with the echoes of her ancestors at her
  back.
  .
  Bat Lizard Bonanza features a rocking soundtrack, seven levels, and over 14 boss
  fights.
  .

  .
  Bat Lizard Bonanza is the third game in the MULEniverse series, which
  narratively extends the work of Danielle Bunten Berry's MULE economic simulator
  game.
  .
  The MULEniverse games include:
  .
  1. Wampus
  .
  2. Wart Worm Wingding
  .
  3. Bat Lizard Bonanza
  .
  4. Leggite Luta Livre
  .
  5. neMULEsis
  .
  ***
  .
  Controls
  .
  Directional Pad -- move in 8 directions.
  .
  B -- fire (standard projectile and then additional powerup projectiles).
  .
  Start -- pause.
  .
  Once weapons have been fully upgraded, all subsequent weapon upgrade pickups
  become screen-clearing triggers -- BOOM!
  .
  ***
  .
  FOR THE BEST EXPERIENCE: I recommend getting an original NES controller and a
  USB adapter for it. You can find one here or here. You can also use any gamepad
  for a similar experience.
  .
  ***
  .
  Bat Lizard Bonanza was made possible thanks to NESMaker, an engine developed to
  make NES development accessible.
  .
  In order to play Bat Lizard Bonanza, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend
  FCEUX. Many emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper
  NESMaker uses for its games.
  .
  Once you have FCEUX downloaded, start it up and open the Bat_Lizard_Bonanza.nes
  ROM. The game should work fine.
  .
  FOR MAC USERS: Download OpenEMU for Mac. When you open the program, right click
  on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select "Default
  Core." Then select FCEU.
  .
  This game is also playable via the Everdrive and Powerpak, provided you have
  updated to Mapper 30 support. It's also playable via the NES Mini, again
  provided you have Mapper 30 support in your emulator of choice.

developer: monothetic
publisher: monothetic
genre: Action
description:
  In Beacon you play as interstellar mercenary Freja Akiyama, stuck in an endless
  search for her distress beacon after crash landing onto an unknown planet. With
  your Clone Bay stuck in an automatic printing cycle, death is only a minor
  setback. Each life you'll not only scavenge for weapons and items to help you;
  you'll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. After your inevitable
  death you're given the opportunity to alter your genome, allowing you to change
  your statistics and gain gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next
  clone's life.
  .
  In the search for your Beacon, new questions arise; just how many clones of
  Freja are there? How long has she been stuck in an infinite cycle of survival?
  How much of her humanity will be sacrificed before escaping?
  .
  A Rich Multi-Faction World to Scavenge -- Enter at the Kovus Outlands, fight
  your way through the Overgrown Spires, and push through the pollution to the
  cryptic Omega Vault where your Beacon is being held. Collect mementos to
  discover the mysteries behind the 5 Factions on Kovus-18, find Tinkered Weapon
  Variants left behind by previous clones, and track your secrets discovered at
  the end of each level.
  .
  100+ Mutations and 5 DNA Types -- Collect DNA from deceased enemies and alter
  your statistics after death. Gain new abilities with each new clone and alter
  your character into something not quite human.
  .
  300+ Items Spread Across 5 Item Types -- Find your favorite arsenal from unique
  technologies spread across the various factions. Regain an advantage with one
  time use Pickups, activate your reusable Auxiliary, swap your Grenade Mod, stock
  up on Passive Mods, and choose your 2 favorite Weapons.
  .
  100+ Enemies with Champion Variants -- The varied factions that inhabit Kovus-18
  will fight each other as well as you, including hybrid Minibosses that mix
  together the abilities of multiple factions.
  .
  15+ Boss Fights -- Face off against the ultimate lifeforms of each faction
  including the Solus Hivemind, Prism Mainframe, and Tritoraptor Matriarch.
  .
  DNA is the core of Beacon's gameplay loop. Through the use of Freja's state-of-
  the-art Clone Bay and DNA dropped by deceased enemies, after death you're given
  the opportunity to alter your genetic makeup and change your statistics before
  your fresh clone is 'printed' back at the crash site. Each faction has their own
  set of unique DNA and Mutations, allowing you to become a battle-hardened mass
  of metal, a luminous abomination of insect flesh, or anything in between!
  .
  The planet you've crashed on is unfamiliar. The only information available is
  its name - Kovus-18. The rest of the record is blank. It seems that either
  nothing is known about it, or whatever was known has been scrubbed from the
  database. Multiple factions populate its surface, each seemingly at war with the
  others, and all of them hostile to the planet's newest inhabitant... you.
  .
  Having grown up in the backwaters of civilised space, Freja always dreamed of
  adventure. Enrolling in the military at a young age she quickly discovered both
  her natural abilities for combat and piloting spacecraft, and her inability to
  work within the strict regimen of the armed forces. Freja lives and works aboard
  her ship the Ouroboros - a single-berth, heavily-modified light spacecraft that
  boasts state-of-the-art weaponry and facilities.

publisher: Havocfett
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Look, it happens. Periodically, a bear murders someone and takes over their
  online identity in the search for snacks, companionship, and remote networking
  opportunities. Sure, being married to a 700-pound bear who ate and replaced your
  spouse is annoying but, like the common cold, it's something we all live with.
  .
  Bear Acquaintances is a slice of life epistolary game inspired by We Bare Bears
  and Gail Simone's Bear Incident on twitter. But with more casual murder. Play
  normal humans, bears pretending to be humans, and less normal humans pretending
  to be those bears and send comfy letters and well-meaning advice to each other.
  .
  Also, the hilarious consequences of that advice.

description:
  Beast Dream is a game about befriending monsters and going on adventures with
  them. Battle other monsters, explore the world, make friends, and discover dark
  secrets. Beast Dream is inspired by video games like Pokemon, but its focus is
  on the adventure so you won't get bogged down by the numbers-heavy crunch that
  those video games run behind the scenes.
  .
  Included is The Commonwealth, an original setting built for Beast Dream. It is
  inspired by Kentucky, and contains original monsters, moves, and items.
  .
  Beast Dream is a Forged in the Dark game, and also my SWORDDREAM. It's made for
  lighthearted games where death and trauma aren't constant dangers. You don't
  take harm, but situations go from bad to worse and friendships can become
  strained by failure.
  .
  Art by Cole Riz.
  .
  Beast Dream is not complete and is still in early development! Buying the game
  now supports me and gets you the game when it is finished as well as all of its
  playtest versions! There is currently no timeline for when the game will be
  finished, but I am working to update it regularly.
  .
  If you want to play this game for a podcast, message me on Twitter and I'll send
  you a free copy! I'm also open to trading games if you're a game designer.
  Otherwise, if there are community copies available, feel free to claim one if
  you can't afford the game!

  "You and your family are survivors. You survived the old world, you survived

  world or we will be part of it's ruins. Yes, cities, communities, pretzels,
  laughs. We need a city to be citizens. We need houses to belong."
  .
  Before the Beginning is a game of scavengers and their families struggling to
  build a city in a post-apocalyptic world. You will face moral challenges and
  dangers of all sorts: witches, doomsday religious cults, cyborgs, mutants...
  everything to build a home, to belong somewhere. Once the city is built, you can
  finally rest. Until there, there's no room for cowards.
  .
  To build the city you must manage not just your character sheet but the city
  sheet. Don't fool yourself, finding the right objects can be harder than you
  think. A lot of families already died trying, you can bet. But I trust in you. I
  know this shelter will become a beautiful city and maybe our children will be
  the mayors of it someday. Let's hope for the best!

  .
  In Behind the Magic, you'll create a fantasy mockumentary by playing a group of
  incompetent adventurers on a quest to save the world.
  .
  Players take turns setting up and acting out scenes in character. These scenes
  are interspersed with reality-television style "confessionals" with the Bard who
  is documenting their journey.
  .
  Key Facts
  .
  Players: 4-7, no facilitator needed
  .
  Time: 2-3 Hours
  .
  Preparation: none, though one player should be familiar with the rules
  .
  Location: A single large space where players can move around and act out scenes
  .
  Materials needed: A printed copy of the rules, at least one chair, nametags
  (optional)
  .
  The game starts with ~30 minutes of setup where you select a quest, build the
  setting, and create your characters. Then you'll spend 60 - 90 minutes playing
  out the adventure and seeing if the heroes succeed... or at least don't make
  things worse.
  .
  The scenes themselves feel like structured improv, without an audience. Each
  scene has a question or tension embedded in it and players act it out until
  they're satisfied. Example: The party tries to calm down the mayor after
  accidentally burning down the town.
  .
  People are saying great things about the game:
  .
  Every time I've played Behind the Magic it has been the ideal combination of
  brilliant, stupid, and adorable. It feels like the perfect D&D session brought
  to life - a parade of calamity and failure with lots of heart. - Jason
  Morningstar
  .
  Even in alpha, this game made me laugh until I cried at several points. It's
  such a delight. - Ash Kreider
  .
  Randy's game "Behind the Magic" is some of the most fun I've ever had playing a
  LARP. - Jeeyon Shim
  .
  The rules are written for embodied play, walking around the room in character.
  However, there are variant rules for playing it at a table. The game has been
  playtested thoroughly with beginner and advanced storytellers and works well for
  players of all skill levels.

  Thank you for such an awesome game - I loved reading Runecairn and it's on my
  list of 2022 games to get to the table. And the layout is lovely too.

  .
  If you're looking for a moderately crunchy duo TRPG, or if you're a fan of Souls
  games, or if you want to see a stellar adaptation of video game mechanics to
  tabletop, I would strongly recommend giving Beneath the Broken Sword (and
  Runecairn) a shot.
  .
  - Richard Kelly (@SprintingOwl), designer
  .
  Beneath the Broken Sword really works. It teaches the player how to play the
  game, and the Warden how to design new levels. It's compact, to the point and
  well written. The layout is good, and in keeping with OSR+ design philosophy.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  You were assigned to one another. Neither of you had a choice in the matter.
  Perhaps you have had a hundred pilots before, perhaps you are fresh off the
  factory line. Maybe you are a seasoned fighter, maybe you have never seen combat
  outside training. Whatever the case, the powers that be who keep you in this
  bitter war have decided it is unnecessary for you to communicate. You will do
  your jobs, never quite knowing if the other is there, or how they might feel...
  .
  Beyond Reach is a two person play by post game about falling in love with
  someone unattainable to you.  One player is a mech, the other their pilot. You
  will write letters that the other character may never see, but will inform your
  epilogues in compelling, and often heartbreaking, ways.

  What the game is about
  .
  "Beyond Super: Life Behind the Mask" is a one-player journaling game that takes
  a peek behind the mask of a superhero.
  .
  The job of superheroes is just like many other jobs, at some point it becomes
  routine. But other challenges arise around it. Missed your moms birthday because
  you were saving the city from Doc Trine? Handed in work late because you were
  busy running from an intelligent turtle turned supervillain?
  .
  How do you deal with the challenges of a regular life once you have a handle on
  your after-hours job? Can you keep a regular job? A relationship? Raise kids?
  Who do you have to lie to and who can you be honest with?
  .
  The stakes are not if you can save the city. They are unfulfilled dreams,
  burnout, loss of identity and loneliness. Who you have to lie to, who you don't
  spend enough time with, who you lose, and who you have to pretend to be, to
  protect those you love most.
  .
  What the characters do
  .
  The characters in this game try to navigate regular life while dealing with all
  the issues that come with it, in addition to those that come with their after-
  hours job of being a superhero. They will have to prioritize, sacrifice, lie and
  pretend, while attempting to lead two lives at once.
  .
  What the player does
  .
  The player creates a world and character, interprets prompts and tells the story
  of their character. They are both writer and director and decide how their
  character navigates life by creating a journal entry for each week during a year
  of their characters life.
  .
  Notes
  .
  Players: 1 (optional 2 player rule)
  .
  Duration: a couple of hours, depending on how detailed you write
  .
  This game was created as a submission to the "Beyond The Super" jam held by
  Riley Rethal and is based on "The Quiet Year" by Avery Alder.

  Press
  .
  "Eight years in the making, Philip Bak's debut project is a twin stick shooter
  in which chaotic genius can be found." - Simon Parkin, Eurogamer
  .
  "The link between Bezier and Asteroids is more than simple coincidence. The game
  is evidently inspired by the Atari classic, even containing its own white-
  outlined chunks of space rock that subdivide when shot by the player. Unlike
  Asteroids, however, blasting Bezier's meteoroids will release a triangular
  'Firefly', which follows and fights alongside the player. In this and a dozen
  other ways Bezier elevates Atari's initial concept, transforming that elegantly
  spartan shoot 'em up into a thrilling kaleidoscope of breathless mayhem." - Rick
  Lane, Bit-Tech
  .
  "It's a hectic twin-stick shooter that has effortlessly swallowed my entire
  morning, and is probably going to eat up most of the evening too." - Christian
  Donlan, Eurogamer
  .
  "Bezier is a shiny twin-stick shooter, complete with all the explosions and
  mayhem that entails, and it's very good at that. What it adds on top of that is
  a story told only in snippets at the beginning of each stage. At least, to start
  with. When it starts reinforcing the story through gameplay, the cruelty of the
  villain becomes more than just words." - Lena LeRay, Indie Games
  .
  "It all makes for a captivating, unique and slightly unhinged experience. And I
  love it so very much." - Rob Fearon, Retro Remakes
  .
  "The soundtrack itself is worthy of praise. I paid the extra few dollars in
  order to get it, even though I had no idea if it'd be any good, and I'm glad I
  did. It's phenomenal." - Tyler Selig, MediaDetour
  .
  "Bezier is a fast paced twin stick Geometry Wars-Style blaster full of varied
  enemy design, frantic gameplay and more visual flair than a burning Lamborghini
  filled with fireworks and glitter." - Calum Fraser, AlphaBetaGamer
  .
  "It's beautiful and more than a little wacky." - Ben Barrett, Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  Player Feedback
  .
  "Outstanding. Here's an example of a game that both quintessentially represents,
  as well as broadens its genre. If you enjoy dual stick shooters, this is
  unmissable." - Gabrienb @ Steam
  .
  "Gave the game a try. Just wanted to take a quick look as I didn't have enough
  time to really get into it. Felt like I wouldn't be able to stop playing unless
  the world ended. This game is awesome." - Germaximus @ Steam
  .
  "Great fun. I've been waiting for this game for ages and it doesn't disappoint.
  Very fast moving and addictive. There's no time to rest, there's enemies to
  kill!" - ash @ Steam
  .
  "Is it that good you ask?...why yes..yes it is. This may well be in the top 5
  twin sticks I've played and yes I've played alot over the past 35 years of
  gaming starting with Robotron at the age of 4." - Fishsticks @ Steam
  .
  "All I can say in the end is it reminds me of all those days I spent playing
  away on the machines at my granda's old arcade. That alone makes this wonderful
  for me." - GeT_JoYe @ Steam
  .
  "Gorgeous Neon effects hectic action and LOTS of enemies to take out followed by
  an epic soundtrack. If you like twin stick shooters like Geometry Wars you'll
  love this. I've only been playing for 1 hour (lol) at the time of typing this
  and I already know I'm going to get a lot of enjoyment here. Do I recommend it?
  I most certainly do :D 9/10" - TheEndlessVortex @ Steam
  .
  "Beautiful game with a fantastic soundtrack. I'm a sucker for twin-stick
  shooters and this tried to bring something different to the market with the
  story." - fnminman @ Steam
  .
  "Interesting twin stick shooter with slick graphics, fun, tough gameplay and
  great music." - mojoxrisen @ Steam Greenlight
  .
  "The game is really, really amazing - looks great, sounds great (soundtrack is
  on Bandcamp if you'd like to preview it) - loads of original ideas etc. Can't
  recommend this enough" - shrewdlogarithm @ Steam Greenlight
  .
  "I seen it for 30 sec and bought it and let me tell you is pretty amazing.. it
  brings an excitement games of this type do not have. Vote for this game I highly
  recommended. Music is pretty awesome too.. One of the best sound tracks I heard
  this year." - Knight-Crawler @ Steam Greenlight
  .
  "I bought it on Desura and I would buy it again on Steam to support the
  developer. This is unabashed old school gaming madness!" - jcaracc2003 @ Steam
  Greenlight
  .
  "Holy crap this game is great This is the twin stick shooter evolved Took a few
  minutes to get my head round it, but once I did - OMFG Beautiful art style,
  OUTSTANDING soundtrack and really tight gameplay - Love it to bits" - Midian808

  IronSoldier @ Eurogamer

  during your 6 years development process." - MrModeste @ Desura
  .
  "Read about this on Rock Paper Shotgun and had to check it out, and I'm very
  glad I did. Great looking, amazing music and quality voice work. I love the
  visual design." - alffly @ Desura
  .
  "Holy crap this game is great. The soundtrack alone is enough to justify a
  download" - DYFE @ Desura
  .
  The Blaster Is A Dying Heart
  .
  Bezier is a dual stick blaster set inside a vast computer built deep
  underground. The story traces the principal's escape from this "Noah's Ark" gone
  wrong. A simple shooter on the surface, the deeper narrative pulls in his
  relationship between evolution and god, family and love. These themes question
  his motives, force him to confront what is real and lead him to salvation.
  .
  Powered by the BezierSynth traditional rendering is renounced in favour of a
  fluid aesthetic guided by story elements, player interaction and the audio
  engine. An eighty minute soundtrack blends together orchestra, synthesizers and
  many ethnic instruments to drive the drama through fifteen zones. Almost one
  hundred different enemies, voice acting, reward based achievements and different
  game modes make Bezier the mindless blaster with a big heart.
  .
  Support
  .
  If you have any problems with Bezier then firstly, we're very sorry that has
  happened. It is certainly not supposed to. Secondly, please get in touch with us
  at hello@thalamusdigital.co.uk and we will do our best to sort that out.

  Accessible parallel gameplay, information gathering puzzle game where you must
  solve puzzles to prevent threats from bringing harm to Secret Government agency
  #1's specialized disguise source, Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium.
  .
  Vocally Driven Puzzle-Point and Click filled with clever dialogue,
  ridiculousness, general befuddlement, and lots and lots of moustaches. After
  catching wind of a sinister plot to destroy Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium,
  a lone savior sets out to defend the city's largest moustache provider!
  .
  By switching between radio channels (by selecting presets or typing in new ones
  you find), noting the enemy's movements, and piecing together the clues, you can
  unravel the plans of your foes and stop them! The project is aimed at being
  color-blind friendly and uses shades instead of color variations to indicate
  need of interaction. It is also non-hearing friendly as subtitles are provided
  throughout. We had aimed to include accessibility for the blind but ran out of
  time. The game is in fact playable by such a person but may require assistance
  for selecting channels and inputting responses. Future planned features includes
  keyboard as input for the game focusing on use of the numpad rather than the
  qwerty section of the keyboard for ease of use and possibly custom hardware for
  blind user interfaces.

  It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a bird in possession of good health
  must be in want of some dirt.
  .
  Birds Love Dirt! is a game about being a bird and loving dirt. It encourages you
  to get outside, imagine birdhood, and most importantly, play in some dirt. Or
  mud, sand, gravel, heck even snow would probably work! As long as you can
  interact with it as a bird and get messy, it's fair game.
  .
  The game is played in three phases, Exploration, Declaration, and Dirt. Some
  Variations are included to provide ideas for playing in a group, with children,
  or indoors.
  .
  If you can't afford this game, please claim a community copy! No conditions, no
  questions asked. I intend to keep them available for anyone who needs them.
  .
  This game is a direct result of my experience volunteering on Kuaihelani (Midway
  Atoll) and is dedicated with gratitude and love to all my friends there,
  especially my fellow peas. I miss our dance parties, baking together, quiet
  reading hangouts, and so much more. I'd also like to thank my friend Lizzie for
  reading my drafts, keeping me motivated to make this game the best it could be.

  Kotaku AU: PSA: There's Another Carly Rae Jepsen RPG (by Alex Walker) - 8/7/2019
  .
  "First there was the sci-fi heist to break out all of Carly Rae Jepsen's
  unreleased songs, and now there's a cultist RPG. Where all your mutations are
  based off Carly Rae Jepsen lyrics.
  .
  It's called Black Heart, and it's a one-shot RPG from the maker of that Carly
  Rae Jepsen RPG called Boy Problems. It's the second one-shot tabletop RPG in a
  trilogy that's themed after the Canadian pop star, but instead of being about
  her music, it's ... much darker."

  Well, it's in the itch.io bundle. In fact, it might just be the most important
  game in there. So go on, what are you waiting for? Purchasing the bundle just
  for Carly Rae wouldn't be crazy."

  Bell of Lost Souls: There's Not One But TWO Carly Rae Jepsen RPGs And They Are
  Weird And Wonderful
  .
  (by J.R. Zambrano) - 17/7/2019
  .
  "This is an incredible premise, and more importantly, it shows what depths RPGs
  can explore. These are all created from Carly Rae Jepsen's music, and each takes
  on a wildly different genre, theme, even play style. All of this highlights both
  the transcendant nature of CRJ's musics, and the deeper truths they speak upon,
  while also showing us the beauty of RPGs. They're about playing pretend and you
  can make them about anything. And people do.
  .
  That's the same spirit of inventiveness and creativity that kicked off this
  game. And when you look around at all the big releases, for instance, Gen Con
  this year is chock full of licensed IP games from big publishers and sequels to
  smash hit games. These are safe choices that deliver an experience that, while
  enjoyable, is the same basic experience we have been having since 1974. We need
  games like the Jepsen Triptych to capture that weird, experimental feeling that
  drives humanity ever onward."

description:
  1983. North East Scotland. An engineer is sent to an abandoned, clandestine
  research facility and is tasked with decommissioning equipment and gathering
  research material left by scientists. As the engineer travels deeper into the
  void, they are thrust into an unstable world of phantasmagorical horrors.
  .
  "There are so many neat touches, like the occasional shift to Resident Evil-
  style fixed cameras, the surreal, distorted dream sequences, and the fuzzy
  videos that use old science stock footage to creepy effect. The Black Iris does
  weird extremely well, and it's clear the developer has an eye for this
  particular style of subtle, gnawing horror. It really got under my skin as I
  played it"  PCGamer
  .
  "A lot of games throw around the phrase "cosmic horror" nowadays, but few manage
  to deliver it as well as The Black Iris does. As soon as you step into the
  facility the atmosphere is electric and there's a real feeling of awe as you
  unravel the enormity of what's going on there. The retro styled visuals and
  vibrant purple-hued color palate are superb and the audio design is incredible.
  It's a mind-blowing experience. Highly recommended." AlphaBetaGamer
  .
  "You are presented with a uniquely horrifying world without the need to shove
  gore in your face or hide jump scares around every corner. The Black Iris is an
  unnerving experience that feels like a Lovecraft short story."  Happy Mag

description:
  They are alone, seeking a secret place. They are dead set on getting there.
  .
  Black Mass is a roleplaying game about two people leaving a community that
  doesn't want them, to the woods that calls for them. Those travelers, Lydia and
  Catherine, confront their pasts to seek their own black mass, a moment of
  transformation, to put the tools of change into their own hands.
  .
  Black Mass is a tarot-based tabletop roleplaying game played in one sitting over
  the course of two to three hours. Black Mass is for four to eight players,
  including a proctor, who facilitates the game.
  .
  Black Mass is a pointillistic tarot-based roleplaying game where players share
  responsibility over two travelers, Catherine and Lydia.
  .
  Players take on portions of their personalities, called personas. We join in
  their successes, their defeats, and we all sign their names into the devil's
  book together. During a game of Black Mass, players take turns inhabiting
  different elements of their histories, personalities, and tendencies. Personas
  revolve around relationships, emotional experiences, discovery, and growth. Each
  persona is different and sketches out a different piece of each character. Each
  player gets two: one for Lydia and one for Catherine.
  .
  We play to find out who they are, why they left Salem, and what they find in the
  woods. Once we know that, we'll find out what they do after their black mass.
  .
  Black Mass is a game about discovery: through play we learn about Catherine and
  Lydia, informed by the in-play personas. No two games are similar, and no two
  Catherine's and Lydia's are the same between playthroughs. There are ten
  personas for both Catherine and Lydia, resulting in many unique combinations at
  the table.
  .
  Throughout the game, players draw tarot cards to overcome obstacles and to add
  to the spread, two rows of cards in the center of the playspace. The spread
  represents the lives of Catherine and Lydia, each card symbolizing a moment in
  their past, present, and future.
  .
  Tarot cards act as action resolution and oracles. When a persona begins
  inhabiting Catherine or Lydia, the player draws cards from the central pile and
  adds those card to their personal stack of cards, called the cairn. Players
  spend cards out of their cairn to move silently, shrug off spectral voices, bear
  the cold, and negotiate their path through the woods. Only one player may act as
  Lydia and Catherine at a time, and when they're out of cards, they're no longer
  in control.
  .
  At the end of these turns, players may add a card to the spread, narrating a
  scene from their present or past.
  .
  The proctor of Black Mass facilitates the game, providing challenges for the
  personas, and taking actions. The proctor guides the personas through the
  prologue, confronts them in the woods, and sets them free during the black mass.
  .
  Black Mass has three modes of play, October, December, and February. An October
  game of Black Mass has bubbling cauldrons and flying broomsticks. A December
  game of Black Mass focuses on eerie exploration and introspective journeys. A
  February game of Black Mass has cloven hooves and bloody snow.

  Winner: 2015 Golden Geek, RPG of the Year
  .
  Winner: 2016 Indie RPG Award, Game of the Year (also Best Production and Best
  Support)
  .
  Blades in the Dark is a tabletop role-playing game about a crew of daring
  scoundrels seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of an industrial-
  fantasy city. There are heists, chases, occult mysteries, dangerous bargains,
  bloody skirmishes, and, above all, riches to be had - if you're bold enough to
  seize them.
  .
  You and your fledgling crew must thrive amidst the threats of rival gangs,
  powerful noble families, vengeful ghosts, the Bluecoats of the city watch, and
  the siren song of your scoundrel's own vices. Will you rise to power in the
  criminal underworld? What are you willing to do to get to the top?
  .
  In this game, you'll find:
  .
  Rules to create your scoundrel using the following character archetypes: the
  Cutter, the Hound, the Leech, the Lurk, the Slide, the Spider, or the Whisper.
  .
  Rules to create your crew, built from types like Assassins, Bravos, a Cult,
  Hawkers, Shadows, or Smugglers.
  .
  A robust core mechanic which puts the fiction first-the strength of a
  character's position (desperate, risky, or controlled) matters just as much as
  the character's ability scores.
  .
  A lightning-fast mechanic for planning criminal operations to cut through the
  usual slog of planning at the game table.
  .
  Rules for alchemical experiments, gadget tinkering, and weird occult powers-

  "This is genius. ... This is spectacular. ... I want to play this game, like,
  today." -- Overly Sarcastic Productions (The Bleak Spirit part starts at
  1:11:08, but the whole video's worth watching.)
  .
  "@potatocubed's homage to the Soulborne genre ... magnificently captures the
  essence of it by adapting the Lovecraftesque diceless storytelling system by
  Black Armada"
  .
  -- MacGuffin & Co
  .
  Bleak Spirit is a storytelling game where you and your friends create a
  brooding, cryptic tale about a stranger in a strange land. Everything is falling
  apart, crumbling, corrupted, and the wanderer carries the potential for a return
  to past glories - or the power to sweep away all that remains.
  .
  Everyone contributes to the tale, sharing the sense of mystery that comes from
  no-one knowing the entire truth of what's going on. Everyone takes turns being
  the world for a scene, introducing lore which hints at the history of the
  setting. After every scene everyone leaps to conclusions based on the lore which
  has been revealed - and these conclusions affect the sorts of lore they will
  introduce when it's their turn to be the world.
  .
  Of course, everyone is going to interpret the lore in their own way, and
  introduce their own variations. You'll have to adjust your conclusions based on
  their input, they'll adjust theirs based on yours, and the story that results
  will be truly the creation of the whole group.
  .
  You will all also take turns playing the wanderer - the destiny-wreathed
  individual who is going to bring change to the world, one way or another. The
  wanderer is the one who faces the dangers of the world, who discovers the lore,
  and who will ultimately leave things different to how they found them.
  .
  At the end of the story the wanderer will enter a proving ground where they will
  confront an adversary. Everyone will have contributed their own lore to the tale
  but only one of you will determine who or what the true enemy is, and what sort
  of future the wanderer will usher in.
  .
  Finally, anyone who is not currently playing the wanderer or the world will join
  the chorus. Their role is to elaborate on details introduced by the other
  players, drenching the world in both grandeur and decay.

  BLUE SHIFT
  .
  Humanity was obviously not meant to explore the stars. Short lives versus
  centuries of travel, hard vacuum versus soft tissue, indefinite isolation versus
  creeping madness. And what is there to explore? Ice, gas and barren rocks
  irradiated by alien suns.
  .
  And so, naturally, a ship of humans departs the solar system.
  .
  ~
  .
  Blue Shift is a tabletop space travel roleplaying game that's more about the
  crew than what they find in the great unknown: what tears them apart, what might
  bring them together and how they deal with crisis. It's designed with single-
  session play in mind: a good game of Blue Shift should be like a tense, dramatic
  science fiction film or short.
  .
  The game consists of instructions for play and detailed sheets for roles to
  guide your play. The game is available free of charge but donations are welcome

  Blue King
  .
  Far back in the Neverwhen, before time can be remembered, you were King. The
  only King. The very energies of Creation coursed through your veins. Alas, time
  wounds all heals. Slowly, you ground to a halt, sinking into the earth.
  .
  Dead. Slumbering.
  .
  And yet, you carry on. Creation leeches from your bones into the world. As you
  decay and slip into nothingness, you form the basis of all existence in this
  world.
  .
  And so, you sleep and slip away, remembering.
  .
  Guardians
  .
  The King is guarded by the Blugard, ancient guardians tasked with defending the
  body that brings life to the world. It is known that the fate of all living
  beings is tied to the fate of one powerful corpse. Chosen for the loyalty and
  sense of duty, the guardians are sustained by faith and their proximity to the
  King's eternal energies. The guardians never leave the presence of the King. If
  their faith wavers, they are replaced by creatures more suited to the task.
  .
  Time & Rest
  .
  The King is in perpetual service. Entropy stops for no one. And yet, there will
  be downtime. Across the ages, not every moment is worth remembering. This is the
  Rest. During Rest, you will select how long the King is at Rest and wait the
  appropriate amount of time. This may be seconds or several minutes, representing
  the passage of time before a new Guardian is selected.
  .
  Blugard is a solo journaling roleplaying game based on the Lost & Found SRD.  In
  it, you play a dead King, dreaming and giving life to the world through the
  ages. It was made for a "picture and a thousand words jam" on the Alone Together

genre: Adventure
description:
  Bonbon is a short horror story, about your childhood.
  .
  Even if you weren't a small child in the 80s, you've been here before. Just you
  and your friendly toys. But this new friend... this is something you are not yet
  able to understand.
  .
  Includes Steam key.
  .
  Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun:
  .
  "a short, smart tale of domestic horror"
  .
  "Bonbon's home, and the voice of mummy shouting from indoors, is authentic"
  .
  "the confusion between what is real and what isn't, and what is threatening and
  what is malign, rings true"
  .
  "a house of horrors that hit far closer to home than most"
  .
  Matt Wales, Kotaku:
  .
  "it's ambitious, it's often fascinating, and there are elements that linger long
  after it's over"
  .
  "there's a lot to admire and appreciate here - from the thread of an entirely
  different story ... to the clarity of vision and the authentic, evocative period
  atmosphere"
  .
  "there's certainly enough craft and creativity here, and a lingering strangeness
  to this everyday terror"
  .
  Bonbon is a short-form domestic horror narrative (or walking sim, if you like),
  made in Unreal Engine 4, set in a suburban UK home in the 1980s, in which you
  navigate childhood events beyond your capacity to understand, and without
  parental context.
  .
  Play time is around 20 to 40 minutes, depending on your play-style. Progression
  requires the completion of some simple tasks, but it is mostly about exploring
  the objects and events around you. Play with mouse and keyboard, or a 360-style
  gamepad.
  .
  Content warnings:
  .
  Bonbon deals with grown-up themes and suggestions of child-abuse. There is no
  literal violence or onscreen abuse, it is entirely in the subtext.
  .
  There is one jump-scare near the end of the game.
  .
  As one player pointed out in a review, the game does contain a racial slur in
  the dialogue (g***y), which was carefully considered as relevant to the source
  material of the scene, and the setting in the UK in the 1980s.
  .
  If you purchase the DRM-free version via itch.io, you will be able to request a
  Steam key via the link on the download screen.
  .
  Recommended system specifications for Windows PC version:
  .
  GeForce GTX 950, or equivalent/faster graphics card
  .
  Quad-core processor, 2.5GHz or faster
  .
  8Gb RAM or more
  .
  Windows 7 or later
  .
  Thanks to Joel Goodwin for providing some very important last minute feedback!

  The Bonds That Tie Us is a GMless TTRPG about characters, and their

  the course of a few Chapters, such questions may be answered.

  It is designed for 3-5 players, though it can also be used as a solo
  storytelling tool. To play, you only need six-sided dice, character sheets,
  something to write with, and a willingness to make things complicated.

developer: testzero

genre: Role Playing;Adventure
description:
  On January 1st, I challenged myself to design, develop, and publish a complete
  game in 1 month. This is that game.
  .
  The original idea was to tell a somewhat cliche RPG story with one critical
  change: You play as the monsters.
  .
  Ozymandias is an imp living in the valley near Detritiville. He's a scavenger;
  searching caves and battlefields for loot and equipment that he can sell and buy
  supplies, but when he finds an old book with a powerful aura, he is drawn into a
  quest that spans the continent to uncover the mystery of the book's origins.
  .
  I know it's nothing spectacular and it uses mostly premade assets, but hopefully
  it makes up for that with solid map design and writing.
  .
  Thank you for coming on this journey with me.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Approx. 8-10 hours of dungeon-crawling adventure.
  .
  Fun and creative story with deep lore and interesting characters.
  .
  No lootboxes.
  .
  No pay-to-win BS.
  .
  3 different endings.
  .
  Controls quick guide:
  .
  Z, Space, Enter - Confirm, select actions, talk to people, interact with objects
  .
  X, Esc - Cancel commands, back out of options, open the menu
  .
  Q/W - Quick switch through characters on equip/status screen
  .
  Shift - makes the character dash, except on the overworld map
  .
  Arrow Keys - Move
  .
  Alt+Enter - Full Screen

description:
  The Bookshelf is a game about taking the time to organize your books, remember
  their value, and rewrite a story based on the stories you have already created.
  If you have toys, photos, or magazines, you think about different merits and
  continue the narrative.
  .
  At the end of your bookshelf you can choose to write another part of the story,
  put your writing aside, or pass The Bookshelf --and your own story--along to a
  friend. Perhaps they will add to your story or write a new one themselves.
  .
  The demos are all you need to play, and they are available for free. The pretty
  $2.00 version is a one-page mini zine, and you see it in the screenshots to the
  side. Message & follow me at @_linfinn if price is an issue, and you'll receive
  the game, no questions asked.
  .
  This game was created by Linda H. Codega for Short Rest, the #CozyGameJam. All
  interior images are from Clip Art Etc.  Books have always been important to me,
  and have always helped me to cope with tough times and stressful situations. I
  hope that this game allows other people to remember why they're keeping all
  those old editions around.

  14 hours from now: Your thumbs mash the smooth buttons of your gamepad, as a
  bead of sweat drips down your forehead. The smell of pizza rolls burning fills
  the air. You fire a flurry of moos and herd five enemies together while narrowly
  dodging a bullet. One extra life left, the funky music steadies your breath and
  re-focuses you. You press the "slow-moo" button and perfectly position yourself
  to unleash a massive FART! The gas radiates outward and annihilates the enemies
  in a satisfying cascade, multi-colored explosions bursting in rapid succession.
  Your point total grows, inching closer to your highest score.

  surely beat your personal best. The smoke burns your eyes. Just one more level.

  .
  Use herding, slow-time, and your bovine blasts to set off satisfying chain
  reactions.

  Twin-stick controls get you in the flow of the fun and challenging gameplay.

  Save points make the game easy to dive back in. Play for a few minutes, or spend
  hours trying to beat your last high score!
  .
  A funky soundtrack from airvoss!
  .
  Silent-but-deadly mode, if you want to turn off the fart sounds.

  Brathian
  .
  A long time ago Brathian was a land full of magical energy.

  Many years passed, and the books telling this story were found. Someone read the
  books awakening the guardians of the crystal and shaking Brathian.

  The descendants of the elders, Edgar and Amy, took to themselves the duty to
  defeat the guardians, gain their power to fight whoever is trying to take the
  crystal.

  What better way to spend an evening than gathered around listening to a classic
  tale of a brave hero saving a princess from a sinister demon lord bent on ruling
  the world? Sure, it may be the same story you've heard time and time again, but
  don't old stories get better with age?
  .
  So here we find our usual crew. A hero, a demon lord, and a princess all
  congregating to tell the story of the hero's triumph and the defeat of a great
  evil. Everyone here know their role and exactly how to carry it out. But what
  happens when the story doesn't go exactly as we know it? What if someone were to
  rewrite the story to something no one within it knows how to enact? Who's
  responsibility is it to put the story back on its track and find the happy
  ending we all know and love?
  .
  ...Wait, didn't we do this once before?
  .
  Well, let's do it again, and we'll make it bigger and better this time!
  .
  Here Comes Brave Hero Yuusha EX!
  .
  This extended version of original Brave Hero Yuusha is Yuusha as you've never
  seen it before! Join the ragtag crew of the Yuusha, Demon Lord, and the Princess
  as they traverse the land to put the story of The Hero and the Demon back
  together and set the world right! Inspired by older console RPGs, Brave Hero
  Yuusha EX features a colorful visual style while keeping that classic adventure
  feel that you've come to love from RPGs of the 80s and 90s.
  .
  Features:
  .
  5+ hours of that old-timey JRPG goodness.
  .
  A stellar new soundtrack by Agent Ape, and the ability to switch to the original
  chiptune OST at any time.
  .
  Fully revamped combat with new skills, improved enemy AI, and a more satisfying
  challenge.
  .
  Skippable encounters! If you are strong enough, flick those mean old random
  encounters away with the press of a button.
  .
  Jokes I thought were funny in 2015 and still aren't.
  .
  New battle animations.

  Choose between two different appearances for the hero.

developer: Brendan Keogh
publisher: Brendan Keogh
genre: Sports;Simulation
description:
  NOTE: This is the original 2018 Pico-8 version and does NOT include the updated
  2022 version available on Steam here.
  .
  Brendan Keogh's Putting Challenge is a Pico-8 golf game about the parts of golf
  that other videogames cut out. Put the ball on the tee yourself. After hitting
  the ball, manually walk to where the ball went before you hit it again. If the
  ball goes in the water, put down another ball! Remove your ball from the hole
  before moving on to the next hole. If you run out of balls, return to the Pro
  Shop to get more balls. This is a golf game with unprecedented interactivity!!
  .
  Sounds tedious? It sort of is! But's it's also kind of relaxing, and it draws
  attention to just how edited and montaged most golf games are in their focus on
  the 'interesting bits'.  Here, the 9-hole course is a single, unified
  experience.
  .
  I've crafted one big world, ten screens by ten screens. Within that world is a
  golf course of 9 holes. You are free to explore and walk around the course, and
  can complete holes in any order you want.
  .
  I developed this game in Pico-8. It was a whole lot of work to get a game of
  this scale and complexity to fit in a Pico-8 cart, and I'm really proud of the
  quality of this final product.
  .
  Wait, why does this game cost $1??
  .
  This is the first time I've set a minimum price for one of my games. All my
  other games are small, quick, slapdash things. While this game is still quite
  small, I also put a considerable amount of work into it over the last few weeks,
  and I think it's important to not contribute to the devaluation of videogame
  labour. So I think it's worth paying a single dollar for. That's less than you'd
  pay for a single round of Time Crisis 2!
  .
  You also get any additional courses I release in the future for free. I've
  already released a second 9-hole course!
  .
  So what do I get?
  .
  $1 unlocks a zip file within which you will find two versions of the game: a
  Pico-8 cart that you can run in Pico-8, if you own a copy of Pico-8; and a HTML5
  version of the game you can run in any browser if you don't own Pico-8. (Note:
  Chrome has issues with audio since an update earlier this year. There's
  workarounds in the readme file. Or just use a different browser.)
  .
  BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!
  .
  Multiple people on Twitter joked that they would pay for golf buggy dlc. WELL
  GUESS WHAT SUCKERS:
  .
  That's right, if you pay $2 for CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION, you get an exclusive day
  one dlc golf buggy! Zip around the golf course up to 4x faster!! Wow!

game: Bringris (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/B/Bringris (USA)/Bringris (USA).json
developer: Zeno Rogue
publisher: Zeno Rogue
genre: Puzzle
description:
  What's the goal?
  .
  Just like in classic falling block games such as Tetris or Blockout, fill the
  levels -- once a whole level (30 cubes) is filled, it disappears. Try to fill as
  many levels as you can!
  .
  How to move?
  .
  wasd to move, space to drop by one level, Enter to drop (you can still move
  after this -- press Enter twice if you don't want to move anymore), hold Shift
  to display cubes missing from the levels below. Press 'p' to pause or see the
  main menu.
  .
  Can I move the camera freely?
  .
  While in pause/main menu, click "explore". You can then use mouse/arrows and
  PageUp/PageDown to freely explore the structure you have built. Do this, the
  views are AMAZING!
  .
  How to rotate?
  .
  There is no key to rotate, but since this game uses non-Euclidean geometry,
  there is no need! Just find a pentagon with five right angles and move along its
  edges.
  .
  (If you change the geometry, a special key for rotation may be necessary -- 'q'
  and 'e' are used for this purpose.)
  .
  How to rotate vertically?
  .
  This game takes place in non-isotropic space -- the 'Z' coordinate works
  differently than the 'XY' plane (which has hyperbolic geometry). Intuitively,
  parallel lines in the XY plane diverge, while vertical lines 'stay parallel'.
  This means that vertical rotation makes no mathematical sense -- the distance
  between the points would change (when rotating around Y axis, points on the XY
  plane would become closer after the rotation, while points on the YZ plane would
  become more distant).
  .
  (You can change the geometry to one where vertical rotation makes sense, but it
  is still not allowed for consistency.)
  .
  But what if you tried to rotate it vertically?
  .
  That's a good question! We do not know if anyone knows. It seems a good research
  question. It is likely that they would resist rotation, just like the springs in
  our world resist changing their shape.
  .
  Why do cubes appear thin when viewed from a distance?
  .
  In hyperbolic geometry, parallel lines diverge, so things become small with
  distance much faster than in Euclidean. Since our space is non-isotropic
  (hyperbolic in XY and Euclidean in YZ), this makes them thinner, but not
  shorter.
  .
  Are the edges of the cubes straight lines?
  .
  Yes -- more formally, they are geodesics. It is clear when the camera is
  positioned right above them. In other positions it may not look so because of
  non-isotropy (see the last answer).
  .
  Why Bringris?
  .
  The "flat level" is a manifold called Bring's surface or Bring's curve, related
  to the small stellated dodecahedron.
  .
  Why is this particular geometry and topology used?
  .
  In the full hyperbolic space, higher levels would have more cubes, which does
  not seem to be a good design for this kind of game. The original plan was to use
  spherical geometry for levels, but that does not give many choices -- only the
  five platonic solids; cube (six squares per level which become cubes in 3D) is
  too small, and icosahedron (20 triangular prisms) and dodecahedron (12
  pentagonal prisms) are very non-intuitive to navigate. Squares with 72 degree
  angles are the best, and Bring's surface is probably the smallest highly
  symmetric surface that can be tessellated with them. With 60-degree angles there
  is another surface (12 squares -- like a cube where every face is doubled and
  you move to the other copy after crossing every edge), but these squares are
  larger, and you could not rotate-by-movement  (with right-angled hexagons you
  could only rotate-by-movement by 180 degrees).
  .
  How is the expert mode different?
  .
  In the normal game mode there is no time limit. In the expert mode, you get less
  and less time for placing the pieces, and also you get score based on how fast
  you are.
  .
  Bringris works with VR!
  .
  Bringris works with SteamVR! (In the Windows version) The game is probably best
  controlled with the keyboard rather than the VR controllers, but it is quite
  cool to explore in VR. You need a powerful graphics card, or change the settings
  (e.g. disable raycasting and/or reduce the number of iterations or cells to draw
  ).
  .
  What engine does it use?
  .
  It is created using the HyperRogue engine aka RogueViz.
  .
  What pieces are available, and what are their frequencies?
  .
  Every piece constructed of 1 to 4 "cubes" is available. The frequency f is
  calculated as follows:
  .
  start with 1
  .
  multiply by the number of symmetries the piece has (identity, vertical,
  horizontal, vertical+horizontal)
  .
  multiply by 2 for purely vertical pieces
  .
  a single cube has frequency 1, not 8
  .
  After a piece is chosen, its frequency is multiplied by 1/2^(1/f).
  .
  What are the differences between the download and the web version?
  .
  The downloadable version has better performance, basic sound effects, and the
  settings can be saved.
  .
  More questions?
  .
  Visit the Bringris channel in the HyperRogue Discord!
  .
  History and Credits
  .
  1.1: introduces alternate geometries, and fixes some bugs (sound effects, score
  counting).
  .
  1.2: more alternate geometries, minor bugfixes, more settings to configure
  .
  1.2b: bugfixes (secret geometries work and are secret (press kl), fixed crash
  after bounded well)
  .
  1.3: added non-orientable hyperbolic manifolds and orbifolds
  .
  1.4: nicer "pentagons" geometry; an option to disable flashes; fixed disabling
  the raycaster; works with VR; nicer wall texture
  .
  1.6: the issue of Bringris crashing on startup on some operating system (unless
  the "Vista compatibility mode" was on) should be fixed. Also updated the engine,
  but this should not have significant effects in Bringris (except the controllers
  shown on the desktop screen in VR).

  For some reason, it appears that, for some people, the game runs better with

  Mask up. Spill blood. Drink the Rich.
  .
  The world is not as it should be. The rich feed, literally, upon the poor, as
  blood-sucking vampires who barely bother to conceal their horrific, parasitic
  nature. The downtrodden peoples of the world struggle under the burdens of rent,
  payable through the sweat of their labor or the blood of their veins. Evil has
  triumphed. Many have given in to despair. But all is not lost.
  .
  In Brinkwood, you take on the role of renegades, thieves, and rebels struggling
  for freedom and liberation in a castylpunk world controlled by vampires.
  Radicalized by tragedy, you have taken up arms and fled into the forests, where
  you were taken in by unlikely allies - the fae, forgotten creatures of myth -
  who offered a different path and the means to fight back against your
  oppressors.
  .
  Masks, forged of old wood and older magic, are the final tool left to fight a
  war long ago lost. If you wear them, they will take their price, etching
  themselves upon your very soul. But they will also let you spill the blood of
  the rich and powerful vampires that now rule the land, and from that blood
  strengthen yourself and your movement.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Build Your Own Apocalypse is a GM-less collaborative storytelling game. You
  decide on the setting. You decide on the characters involved, if any. The story
  is mainly about the events that bring about the decline and destruction of your
  setting. The characters you make up won't be able to stop it, but you could tell
  a story about the villains that make it happen. Build Your Own Apocalypse makes
  a great lead in for many post-apocalypse games with a mysterious precursor.
  .
  The rules for Build Your Own Apocalypse are two pages long. Game play with four
  people takes 2-3 hours. The game is infinitely re-playable and can be played
  with children capable of imagination and rolling dice.

  Included is a list of 30 sets of prompts with questions about your bard's craft
  and lifestyle, as well as a few tables you can pick details from or roll dice to
  choose. There are also 6 ready made characters for you to use in your own TTRPG
  games, stories, or cosplays. The rest of the creation pack can be used to
  further personalize them. The prompts and tables are setting neutral, so you can
  use them with any setting, though not every detail will fit every situation.
  .
  Story comes in many forms. It can be expressed through a myriad of colors in a
  painting, a song rich with feeling, a dramatic voice speaking to an enraptured
  audience, or countless other methods. This is for any character with a story to
  tell, a need to be creative, or a drive to inspire others. I've kept a loose
  definition of bard, because there are many ways to be creative and expressive. A
  bard can travel around singing, or write stories, or express themselves through
  creating inventions. This supplement endeavors to help you step outside the box
  of the stereotypical bard, as well as add depth to your character.

  Sometimes characters come to life easily, but sometimes it's a little trickier
  to coax them into existence or figure out what makes them tick. The little
  details can add a lot of depth, and the details you didn't realize were there
  can end up shaping the whole character. This pack can get you started building a
  character or be used to further flesh out an existing character.
  .
  Included is a list of 30 prompts with questions about your witch's practice and
  lifestyle, as well as a few tables to pick details from or you can roll dice to
  choose. The prompts and tables are specifically witch related, though can also
  be applicable for witch-adjacent characters such as druids or mages. A lot of
  the prompts and options are general enough to work across a wide range of
  settings, from historical to modern to sci-fi.
  .
  There are also 8 ready made characters are for you to use in your own TTRPG
  games, stories, or cosplays. The rest of the creation pack can be used to

  The Buried is a Wretched and Alone game, based on the SRD by Chris Bissette. In
  this solo journaling game it begins with you trapped underground, and you will
  struggle to make it out alive.
  .
  "Why've yall stopped digging?" bellowed McManus from down the tunnel. He was
  bigger than most, but most of that bulk was fat. It had been years since he'd
  had to pull a full days work in the mines, and he made sure it showed.
  .
  Siema pointed over to the...thing. "That's why." Siema was almost as big as
  McManus, and his bulk came from muscle. He was the only one who dared bow up at
  the tyrannical shift leader, and everyone knew there was a reckoning coming one
  day soon.
  .
  McManus sauntered over to the end of the tunnel and for a moment even he was
  stuck silent. They were a good half mile below the surface, a place where their
  digging had made it clear no man had even set foot before. So how there could be
  a half revealed stone doorway, one with swooping spiral sigil that drew the eye,
  yet made your brain want to scream in pain, no one had been able to say.
  .
  After a moment McManus spat, and a hint of greed began to show in his eye. "Keep
  digging. Lets see what's behind that door."
  .
  Seima shrugged, and swung his pick.
  .
  That's the last thing you remember.
  .
  Time has passed, you can feel it. But it's dark, with only the pale glow of your
  headlamp to provide any illumination. There was a cave in, that much is clear.
  Dust fills the air, and you can see a few bodies lying about. Some of your
  shift, but not all, not by a stretch. And from the way your head hurts you can
  tell you took a pretty nasty knock.
  .
  You are in a tunnel though. But clearly not one carved by you or your coworkers.
  This must be what was beyond that door...though where is the door? Is it under
  the cave in? And where is everyone? Under the rubble...or have they followed the
  tunnel looking for a way out?
  .
  You do know one thing: your bosses are probably not going to waste the energy
  trying to dig out a team of miners in a mostly played out shaft, when there are
  a thousand more waiting to take your place. They'll just try another shaft, and
  hope to strike more gold that way. If you want to get out, you're going to have
  to do it yourself you think.
  .
  These tunnels though...you've never seen anything like them. They look carved,
  but not by tools. They look as though they have been clawed into existence,
  though what could claw through granite like that, you haven't a clue. And
  scattered throughout are small piles of bones...and some look to be human. What
  is this place?

  Bury me, my Love is a Text Messaging Adventure game about Nour, a Syrian migrant
  trying to find her way to Europe. Her husband Majd, who remains behind in Syria,
  communicates with Nour through a messaging app, advising her as best he can so
  that she reaches her destination safely.
  .
  "Bury me, my love" is a Syrian goodbye phrase that roughly means, "Take care,
  don't even think about dying before I do." This phrase takes on a deeper meaning
  as Majd says it to his wife, Nour, as she undertakes her perilous journey to
  reach Europe.

  A co-production from ARTE, the European cultural network, with The Pixel Hunt
  and Figs.

  A game in an instant messaging app

  Your choices in Bury me, my Love truly impact on the story, with Nour able to
  visit 50 different locations and reach 19 potential different endings with
  widely divergent outcomes.
  .
  Based on real-life events
  .
  Bury me, my Love is a "reality-inspired game", a documented fiction that draws
  inspiration directly from real-world events. The original idea stems from an
  article written by Le Monde journalist, telling the story of Dana, a young
  Syrian woman who fled her country and is now living in Germany.

  "What is my purpose?" the automaton asked.
  .
  "You pass butter," replied its creator, the words falling in a staccato torrent
  upon the tiny creation's semi-sentient psyche like every hammer upon every
  anvil.
  .
  The weighty words rang out through the space between them in the span of time it
  took for an eye to blink and a universe of possibilities and hope to shatter to
  pieces.
  .
  You.
  .
  Pass.
  .
  Butter.
  .
  No more, no less.  Darkness closes in.  This is all there is.
  .
  You may find yourself making a character for the 5th edition of a popular dragon
  and dungeon adjacent roleplaying game, and in doing so, you may ask yourself,
  "What IS my purpose?"  Finally, there's a character background for you: the
  Butter-Passing Robot.  It's mechanically sound and fit for use in a 5e game,
  though I might suggest it should probably only be used in a campaign with the
  appropriate (read: silly/ridiculous/hope-crushing) tone.  You know, I hear
  there's even a boxed set and book that this would fit seamlessly into.  Hunh.
  .
  This project was quick, simple, and meant for fun, so I hope you get a laugh out
  of it, but if you do choose to use it in a fairly light-hearted, non-overly-
  serious game of 5e, all the relevant bits and pieces are there to make it work
  like any other background.
  .

  It's opening night at the theatre, and you are woefully unprepared to go on.
  .
  Due to a ludicrous level of mismanagement by the director and producer alike,
  you have neglected to hold a single rehearsal. In fact, you haven't even
  bothered to pick up a script. Frankly, you don't even remember what show you're
  supposed to be putting on. All you know for sure is that it's meant to be a
  comedy by the master of the Victorian farce, Oscar Wilde. With only that to go
  on, you're just going to have to improvise.
  .
  By the Author of Lady Windermere's Fan is a story game with two parts. On the
  one hand, you're putting on a comedy of manners in the style of The Importance
  of Being Earnest or An Ideal Husband, which that means a gaggle of self-absorbed
  characters weaving increasingly complex webs of deception to make themselves
  look good, punctuated by as many witty one-liners as you can think up, as they
  careen wildly toward a happy ending they have absolutely not earned.
  .
  At the same time, you're actors doing everything in their power to keep the show
  from grinding to a halt. That means thinking quickly, dashing on-and-off stage
  to change characters, and never EVER stopping for breath while the audience's
  eyes are on you.
  .
  Cobble together a plot out of whatever sets you have on hand.
  .
  Lie, cheat, and steal the spotlight through three breathless acts of quick
  changes, missed cues, and bon mots.
  .
  Do whatever you must to keep the audience's attention until the final curtain.
  .
  Bask in the thunderous applause you so richly deserve.
  .
  By the Author of Lady Windermere's Fan is a role-playing story game for three to
  five players, meant to be played over three to for hours, with no GM and no
  advanced preparation required.
  .
  If you are interested in a physical edition of By the Author of Lady
  Windermere's Fan, it can be purchased as a Print on Demand title from
  DriveThruRPG.

  Notably, this was a game that I designed and wrote years before I came out as
  transgender, and what's it about? A bunch of people going to increasingly
  desperate lengths in order to avoid having to admit to the thing they've lied
  about their whole lives. Inspired by one of the most notorious queer voices of
  the 19th century.

  Kinda... kinda wish someone had pointed that out to me a bit earlier.

  CROSSNIQ+ (CROSS-neek plus) is a speed-focused, arcade-style puzzle game
  inspired by "y2k-era" visual design - a tribute to highly polished, small-scope
  Japanese games from the late 90's.
  .
  In CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form
  "crosses" - rows and column of the same color. You can move tiles up, down, left
  or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the
  other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared
  to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle
  games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos -
  make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.
  .
  In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit
  empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn
  as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds.
  .
  Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves...
  .
  ...or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking playfields
  in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs. No matter your
  playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+ for you!

  .
  CW: violence, murder.
  .
  Cage of Sand is a time loop horror game for one or more players. You will need a
  deck of tarot cards, some paper and something to write with.
  .
  Cage of Sand follows a protagonist only vaguely aware of the fact that time has
  begun to repeat itself. They wake and begin their daily activities, interacting
  with and learning about other the characters that make up the story's cast. A
  seemingly insignificant event marks the beginning of a set of strange and
  gruesome murders, culminating in a deadly disaster before time repeats and the
  memories fade.
  .
  Play to discover the truth.
  .
  Digital Materials
  .
  Cage of Sand was originally designed as an in-person game to be played around a
  table. A few extra tools have since been added to facilitate digital/online
  play: currently, that consists of either a macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet
  containing all the key rules and some programming to draw cards, or a set of
  digital play materials which can be uploaded into your virtual tabletop of
  choice. Further options may be added at a later date.

  This can be easy, or even sometimes deadly. CAMP PROGRAM LEADER PAT has injured

  they recover in the first-aid tent.

genre: Puzzle
description:
  Campfire Cooking is a puzzle game about relaxing moments in nature, as you
  prepare meals over a warm fire. Discover the joy of cooking on a stick and test
  your problem-solving skills with some challenging campfire puzzles! My latest
  creation is guaranteed to make you feel clever, hungry and eager to book your
  next woodland escape.
  .
  Over 100 meals to prepare.
  .
  Solve tricky puzzles with one simple goal; prepare the all the food, cooked to
  perfection and with a hint of smoke. When each meal is ready it's time to trek
  to the next campsite. But don't be fooled: these puzzles are no walk in the
  park, and some of them are a hike up the mountain!
  .
  Meet the family.
  .
  A year long trip and a lot of marshmallows to toast. Follow a vacation like no
  other and listen to the campers as they tell stories, laugh at each other's
  jokes or moan about the lack of cell phone reception. Enjoy the simple moments
  they share around the fire while waiting for their food to be cooked.
  .
  Puzzle-solving, with a twist.
  .
  Twist, rotate and jostle skewers around the fire until each meal is ready to
  eat. Push fondue pots, play with magnets or maybe just use a camping stove if
  the fire won't light. Discover clever ways to solve puzzles at each new locale.
  .
  Visit exotic hiking trails
  .
  Once you've visited all the campsites on one trail, why not hike to another?
  Each trail brings you new vistas brimming with color, different foods to cook
  and fresh fireside stories to hear. Take a journey from the deep woodlands to
  snow-capped peaks, and everywhere in between.
  .
  Please Note: Campfire Cooking currently only supports mouse controls!
  .
  I'll be doing my best to update the game with keyboard and controller support
  soon. Feel free to leave any comments/questions below. Cheers, Hawkes.

  The car is loaded. Your family is eager to escape the city, each one envisioning

  .
  It's time to go camping!
  .
  Campfire Memories is a GMless game about a family going camping, facing
  unpleasant experiences while in the great outdoors, and then looking back on
  those difficulties fondly.
  .
  Players create a family, composed of adults, children, and dogs, filling them
  out with goals and resources they bring to the woods with them.
  .
  While camping things go wrong, as they do for everyone. Weather turns nasty,
  equipment fails, wild animals appear at the worst possible times. How does the
  family react?
  .
  After the trip is over, the family has time to reflect on their experiences.
  What did they learn? What connections were formed or strengthened with the other
  members of their family? What was valuable about even the worst events?

  FROM THE DEVELOPER
  .
  Hey!
  .
  Sometimes, you get an idea and you just wanna turn that idea into a game. Real
  quick. No extensive planning. No big budget estimates. You just wanna get in
  there and get dirty with the gameplay, code and graphics.
  .
  At Hello There Games, we are constantly at work with several bigger productions.
  We love them, and they take up most of our time. But every now and then there's
  an hour there, half a day here. That's where this game got done.
  .
  It's not pixel-perfect-polished. It's not the deepest experience out there. It's
  not the biggest title we've shipped. It's not the smallest either.
  .
  But it is something that we really had fun developing, and really really really
  wanted to share with you before the summer vacation.
  .
  We sincerely hope that you will have fun with it.
  .
  With love,

  The plan is simple. Summon a cabal of universally renowned warriors known as The

  things, seek to dominate friend and foe through the deadliest form of combat
  known to man: pictures on paper rectangles.

  Created with ease-of-learning and FunTimes in mind, Cards: The Attackening! is a
  brilliantly addicting game sure to make you say, "Damn, son, this is better than
  [third party game name redacted]!"
  .
  Cards: The Attackening! features over 100 unique cards: Attackeners (aka
  heroes), Weapons, Armor, Pets, and more! The gameplay has roots in classic TCGs,
  but with a few notable modifications like rolling for damage/defense, a single
  deck for all players (which we call The Arsenal), and Twists of Fate, our
  signature addition to the genre. Twists of Fate either positively or negatively
  alter the gameplay on the Battlefield (or "kitchen table").
  .
  No matter how you play, your enemies will pay!
  .
  Gameplay requires at least one six-sided die. You can use physical ones, of
  course, or leverage any one of a million free dice rollers online. Google will
  also do this for you!

  Cast Away is the definitive tabletop survival RPG. Its Diminishing Dice
  mechanics reflect the ever-worsening condition of survivors in the aftermath of
  a disaster-without tracking Hit Points or burdensome injury tables. Death is
  permanent, therefore, we've created a Haunting system that keeps players engaged
  long after their characters pass away. Cast Away contains a modular set of
  guidelines and is easily adapted to any setting, environment, or circumstance.

  AWESOME... and ADORABLE
  .
  The Cat Hack takes the OSR rules of The Black Hack (1E) and modifies it to work
  with a minimalist setting where the player characters are all cats!
  .
  This is a complete game! The Black Hack is not required, tho I encourage
  everyone to purchase the excellent parent game.
  .
  Humans are frail creatures. Most of them aren't equipped to deal with the
  supernatural. That's where cats come in!
  .
  Only cats can see the threats. Only cats have the spells and abilities to deal
  with them. Once they're done with their nap, of course!
  .
  The game features four kitty classes: Battle Cat, Lithe One, Shaman Cat, and
  Pretty Kitty. While the Shaman Cat specializes in magic, all cats have access to
  spells!
  .
  The game is set in the modern day by default, with a sort of urban fantasy vibe.
  However, there are notes for using kitties in a traditional fantasy setting or a
  scifi setting with The Black Hack (first edition) and The Space Hack,
  respectively!
  .
  Everything you need to start your adorable adventure is here, in a streamlined
  16-page OSR ruleset!

developer: Sage LaTorra
publisher: Sage LaTorra
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Something's not right with the world. There's a rot around you and it's getting
  closer.
  .
  Catch The Devil is a game about normal people caught up in forces beyond the
  real. As a player you'll create a normal person and explore how they react to
  being caught up in events that can't be real. As a GM you'll take your fears and
  make them manifest in the world of the characters as a rot that has designs on
  the player characters.
  .
  When the player characters come under stress they will change in unexpected
  ways. The core rules of the game are different for each character reflecting the
  different ways people handle duress.
  .
  Catch The Devil is by Sage LaTorra, co-designer of Dungeon World. It reflects
  years of experience with Powered By The Apocalypse games and a growing anxiety
  about the world we live in.
  .
  The current version of Catch The Devil is a complete game playable for 1-3
  sessions. Over time I'd like to expand it to a larger game based on some
  interesting ideas about how to handle GM planning, character change, and the
  passage of time. By buying the current version you'll get any future updates for
  free and help support ongoing development.
  .
  Investigate, fight, or flee: there's a rot around you and it's getting closer.

developer: Speak the Sky
publisher: Speak the Sky
genre: Role Playing
description:
  A catch-all collection of free extras that used to have their own pages until I
  corralled them all here. Mostly pretty lo-fi or unpolished (or both), but
  there's one or two gems in here. They're ordered oldest to newest, mostly TTRPGs
  at the top and fonts at the bottom.
  .
  Pockets full of Stars
  .
  A cozy duo role-playing and world-building game about tiny people living on tiny
  planets, and humble giants living on cozy stars.
  .
  Letter Bearer
  .
  A short solo role-playing and world-building game: carry letters through the
  Forest you call home for the mighty, regal Powers that command your life, take
  detours where you can, and weather your lords' cruelties before you can break
  free.
  .
  You in Me
  .
  An in-person epistolary game for two, written on both sides of an index card.
  You're soldiers in a terrible war, writing letters to one another as the
  fighting rages on. You know each other so well that as you write, you can hear
  their voice in your mind.
  .
  Angels of the Railway Stations
  .
  An epistolary game for 2+ players in which you play a liminal community of
  lonely angels. Help lonely travellers in a world undergoing a great upheaval,
  then write about what you see and do to pass it on to the next angel down the
  line.
  .
  This Christmas, Give 'Em Hell
  .
  An action-heist-revenge-ghost movie hybrid role-playing game hacked from John
  Harper's Lasers & Feelings in which you have two stats: Christmas and Ghost. Are
  you a bad enough Ghost to save Christmas?
  .
  From Sea to Shining Sea
  .
  Fear and loathing on the moon-a GM-less tabletop role-playing game for 2-4
  players who're ready to open the dark heart of the shitty future.
  .
  Dirty Papers
  .
  A GM-less game of archaeology and the light and dark sides of academia. Dig
  through ancient ruins, sift the dirt for precious finds, and slowly piece
  together how you think the people here once lived.
  .
  Banned From Argo
  .
  A sci-fi parody role-playing of hapless havoc and reckless R&R by Space-Fleet's
  finest crew, inspired by the (in)famous filk song of the very same name. Hacked
  from John Harper's Lasers & Feelings. You have two stats: A Little Fun and Too
  Much Fun.
  .
  Bodyworks
  .
  A mis-adventure mini-zine game for two players, specifically of the sort who
  want to roleplay body snatchers in a grim, bizarre, alternate London, using the
  board game Operation.
  .
  hOwdy
  .
  A dingbat typeface of weird, unusually happy faces. Ultra-niche and not
  particularly useful, but if it helps, great.
  .
  The Eldritch Ecstasy of Detective Dog
  .
  A GM-less cosmic horror/kids' TV/millennial burnout role-playing game, inspired
  by British childrens' television and the absolute state of things.
  .
  Drowns the Sky
  .
  You are colonists on an alien planet. The End is coming. You know it's coming,
  and you know there's no way to escape, but you still have some time left to do
  what you will. To experience the world, preserve what you can, reflect on your
  past, build for the future, and answer whatever questions remain.
  .
  timeTo
  .
  A set of fonts that let you turn digital times into analog clocks. You just type
  in a time from 00:00 to 11:59 and timeTo converts it into a clock. There's a few
  dozen styles, including one themed after the grandfather clock from Super Mario
  64.
  .
  LilMrkr
  .
  A dense, marker-pen, hand-drawn font with pseudo-randomisation and multilingual
  support. It cycles through up to 12 versions of each glyph to make the font look
  sketchier (unfortunately, this randomisation doesn't work online).
  .
  Minitic
  .
  A tiny 4x4/3x3 pixel font with some calligraphic styling. As much as you can fit
  into that space, anyway. It's also got a decent amount of multilingual support.
  .
  Zenimini
  .
  a pixel-ish floppypunk typeface inspired by some headings from the 1988 British
  superhero/cosmic horror comic, Zenith. It's dense and heavy and comes in four
  styles: Pixel, Flat, Round, and Rough.
  .
  Scryptic
  .
  An italic handwriting pixel font. It does a lot with a little, with the goal of
  looking decently readable even at small font sizes without sacrificing the
  script style. Note: this font relies heavily on kerning to get the letters to
  fit together right, so it won't look as good if you have kerning switched off or
  can't switch kerning on.
  .
  Buried Future
  .
  An unfinished font of heavy geometric characters. The theme was "post-
  apocalyptic monoliths". Maybe 90% of the way there in terms of design, but the
  remaining 10% would make it sing (it's also missing kerning and a few other
  basic features).

game: Cell Tune (USA)

developer: Niklas Riewald
publisher: Niklas Riewald
genre: Simulation
description:
  Cell Tune is a life simulation game. You design creatures on a microscopic level
  and let them fight with other organisms.
  .
  Building your creatures is easy: There are five different cell types that you
  can combine in any way you want. But designing an organism that can strive is
  not quite so simple. You have to consider the level layout and many different
  construction tradeoffs: Little organisms can reproduce very fast but are also
  quickly eaten by bigger ones. Aggressive creatures can decimate your enemies,
  but they are also more likely to digest their own children by accident. And you
  probably don't want an organism that just swims against a wall all the time.
  .
  The game has a tutorial, 12 levels and a level editor. The level editor can be
  used for local multiplayer.
  .
  FAQ:
  .
  Why is there no kick drum like I was promised in the trailer?
  .
  Unfortunately, I had to remove the kick drum because it made the music click and
  pop sometimes. But the good news is that the game will be 50% off, as long as I
  don't get around to including the kick drum again. Yay!
  .
  This makes me sad. Is there a way to turn the kick drum back on?
  .
  Rejoice! There is a way to turn it back on. Just install PureData, then go to
  media/PureData/pd_cellTune_nik2.pd, then go to menuMusic -> drums and connect pd
  kick with pd submixer drums.
  .
  Wait, does this mean I can change up the music system in any way I want?
  .
  Yes, it does. The possibilities with this are endless! (the same thing applies
  to the graphics btw)
  .
  Will there be a Steam version?
  .
  No plans for that. The game will probably stay an itch.io exclusive. If this
  game will sell a million copies I might reconsider.
  .
  This game made me realize that complex behaviour can emerge from quite simple
  rules. Can I use this game to build a human creature having a real soul?
  .
  Glad you ask. It might be possible. But please consider the ethical implications
  before you do so!
  .
  Do you have other games?
  .
  Yes! Please check out my latest game. It's called Wildfox Surfing Paradise and
  it's a surfing game based on a sophisticated fluid simulation.

  CLT is an arcade shooter where enemies learn behaviours from those that went
  before * WebGL Demo * Win/Mac/Linux Versions
  .
  Wait, What Is It?
  .
  Central Limit Theorem is a survival shooter where you have to protect your core
  for as long as you can from the shapes attacking it. It's a quick, simple,
  stressful, high-score shooter designed to be played between other, more
  substantial games.
  .
  Each enemy starts with a unique behaviour (they can shoot, weave, or orbit) and
  they each leave a different coloured ink on the playfield. When another enemy
  crosses this ink later it will learn the behaviours of those that went before!
  .
  The more ink, the more difficult the game becomes!
  .
  * IDGA Scotland Community Choice Award (Edinburgh Winner 2018) *
  .
  How Do I Play It?
  .
  [Fire] - Ctrl/Space
  .
  [Pause] - ESC/P (Use 'P' above as ESC does some odd things with the web player!)
  .
  [Rotate] - Arrow Keys/WASD
  .
  A tutorial will play the first time you run the game. It can be played again by
  shooting the 'Help' button. Shoot the 'Play' button to start a game!
  .
  Protect your core for as long as you can, and aim for a high score!
  .
  Why Should I Buy It?
  .
  Beyond supporting me and encouraging me to make more games, if you buy the game,
  you'll get a proper, customisable Unity-style executable for Windows, Mac, and
  Linux. This will allow you to have:
  .
  *  Higher resolution and different aspect ratios!
  .
  *  Better anti-aliasing for smoother graphics!
  .
  *  The ability to easily save a picture of any run by shooting the 'Photo'
  button
  .
  *  A 'secret' bonus alternative game mode! (Try shooting things in the main
  menu)
  .
  *  Probably much better performance!
  .
  ATTENTION: The design might cause some difficulties for any of you lovely people
  with colour perception issues. Please try the demo and check out the screenshots
  before buying to make sure you won't be disappointed! I believe the game is
  still playable, but it might be more difficult!
  .
  LINUX USERS: Linux graphics drivers and Unity don't seem to play 100% nicely
  together, even when using 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 or newer (the supported Linux OS
  from Unity). Testers reported running in fullscreen causes occasional problems,
  but that windowed mode runs fine. Your mileage may vary!
  .
  When Was It Made?
  .
  I couldn't get along to the Global Game Jam 2018 (#GGJ18), but I decided to
  create something within the same time frame. The theme was 'transmission', so I
  allowed enemies to transmit their behaviours to each other via ink! Since then
  loads of new features and polish have been added to Cental Limit Theorem!

  Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild with a faery, hand in hand,
  for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
  .
  ~ W.B. Yeats
  .
  Description
  .
  Changeling is a GxB, non-stat raising, full-length visual novel about love,
  reconciliation, and trying to survive in a dangerous supernatural world. Play
  through about 30-40 hours of content and over 40 unique endings while trying to
  survive the perils of a newly discovered paranormal community. Romance one of 6
  love interests as you uncover information about the supernatural and the secrets
  from your own past - all while you try to patch up your relationship with your
  twin brother who grows more and more suspicious of you with each passing day.
  .
  Story
  .
  The human world accepted as reality is only a thin veneer under which lies a
  world of supernatural creatures, entities, and people. They live beside humans
  hiding their nature or walking among them unseen. And most people go about their
  lives entirely unaware of the dangers around them. Mysterious situations are
  written off as fake, or they're glossed over with some sort of mundane
  explanation.
  .
  The same was true for Nora, a normal girl struggling with the usual litany of
  everyday problems - including her crumbling relationship with an angry,
  resentful twin brother with whom she's nearly given up on reconciling.
  .
  But her family's return to the town in which she'd grown up set in motion a
  chain of events that would shatter every illusion she had about a world she
  thought she knew. Her eyes newly opened to the truth around her, Nora begins a
  journey to uncover the secrets of her own mysterious past and the reason for her
  brother's bitter hatred toward her. Alongside her best friend, and a group of
  unusual guys she met after her return, Nora begins to chip away at the lies
  shrouding her life. Lies that have been haunting her since childhood.
  .
  But in a world where Vampires, Werewolves, and Faeries are real, learning the
  truth may come at a high cost.

game: Changelings (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/C/Changelings (USA)/Changelings (USA).json
developer: kolekniewiary
publisher: kolekniewiary
genre: Role Playing
description:
  This is a roleplaying game about changelings i.e. fae creatures (the elves, the
  faerie, the fair folk) inhabiting human bodies. While in the mortal realm they
  must control their conflicting nature while fighting for the cause that called
  them onto Earth.
  .
  Characters
  .
  The players take the role of the changelings. The fair folk, the fae left this
  world as the civilization developed and banality ruled. Now, recalled by human
  dreams of a better world, they return as changelings. Infuriated with the world
  that once rejected them, with the people who killed the magic and replaced it
  with Excel spreadsheets. The Faerie, wearing a human body, finds a cause to
  fight for. They come to help the weak and the excluded.
  .
  World
  .
  Urban fantasy with glimmers of hope and magic in the exhausted, dirty world. The
  world burns. Climate catastrophe, galloping inequality, all-powerful
  corporations, and politicians fighting them with hatred. Billionaires, more and
  more resembling Bond villains. In the third decade of the 21st century, things
  seem to be worse than ever before. But there is a glimmer of hope.
  .
  Rules
  .
  "Changelings" are a hack of "Wights" that uses the mechanics, structure, and
  world of the original to give players new possibilities. The rules are based on
  the game "Lasers & Feelings" - they are short, simple, oriented towards
  narration, and joint story-making. The whole thing was created with short,
  action-packed sessions in mind, played without prior preparation.
  .
  No knowledge of the original is required.

  weaknesses. Unlock new songs that give you cool passive powers and build them
  into powerful playlists! Dance, kiss, eat pizza, and do other stuff too!!
  .
  -----
  .
  How to play
  .
  You're moving pieces around the board, using abilities (on the little cards on
  the bottom) and gaining as many Cool Points as you can before the day is over.
  There are currently about a dozen or so different pieces in the game, and each
  party locale has its own special rules and features.
  .
  Tap on a unit to find out where it can move to. Then you can click one of the
  destinations to move it there.
  .
  When a unit is selected, you can also see its abilities on the bottom of the
  screen. If you use an ability, you have to wait a few turns before you can use
  it again - this is called a "cooldown". Wait a few more turns and then try
  again.
  .
  Songs and Playlists
  .
  You start with 2 songs unlocked, but as you gain more stars, more will be
  unlocked. Each song does a different thing passively as you play (you can click
  the Karaoke machine to remind you just what the song's a-doin').
  .
  Probably some songs go good with some kinds of units or something, but you
  probably will also just have your favorite songs. Try stuff out!
  .
  Good luck! <3

  wrath. Everything is boosted by outstanding pixel art and a memorable chiptune
  soundtrack.

  Switch between the protagonists in real-time. Kensei is a samurai who wields a
  lethal katana, but he lacks the ability to jump. Ayame the kunoichi is as fast
  as fragile and uses ranged attacks. Combine their skills to save feudal Japan!
  .
  Overcome old-school platforming challenges. Although retro platformers are our
  main reference, we tried to bring the most satisfying, modern experience to the
  table. Ayame can jump gracefully while Kensei will dash through enemies and
  platforms.
  .
  Fast-paced combat. Chronicles of 2 Heroes' offers a tight combat system that
  changes depending on which character you control. The samurai guarantees
  breathtaking duels using its katana and the ability to parry. The kunoichi can
  vanish behind the enemy to avoid close combat or damage foes from a distance.
  .
  Unlock up to 20 powerful abilities. During their journey, Ayame and Kensei will
  upgrade their abilities. From smashing the ground and stunning your enemies to
  double jumping and reaching higher platforms. These siblings can learn a lot of
  new tricks!
  .
  Imagine a good action platformer without enemies. Impossible, right? Don't
  worry: Chronicles of 2 Heroes is filled with them! Fight against ronin, yokai,
  and countless enemies inspired by Japanese mythology, each one with distinct
  designs and patterns.

  CLAM MAN 2: OPEN MIC is OUT NOW on STEAM AND ITCH!
  .
  The free prologue for the sequel is out already!  Clam Man 2: Open Mic by
  Marafrass
  .
  If you enjoy it, leave a review! It's a huge help for small developers like
  myself, especially with Clam being a personal project with basically 0$ behind
  it!
  .
  Clam Man
  .
  is the story of the Clam Man. Intriguing, isn't it? Yes, it's true - he is a
  clam and yet also a man. This is not a topic of debate, it is fact. We've
  confirmed it while working on this game. Using science.
  .
  "He certainly is a clam man." - Playtester
  .
  Thank You, Playtester - we couldn't agree more.
  .
  But to be more specific: This is the story of a man, recently promoted to junior
  sales representative, enjoying the comforts and leisure of lower-mid-level
  office work. However, things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and the Clam
  Man is cast into an adventure full of danger, suspicion, and mystery. Join him,
  as he unravels the conspiracy behind the tragic event that befalls him, and
  fight to restore CLAMMY JUSTICE to the world of Snacky Bay.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  A story full of twists and turns and a huge amount of strange jokes!
  .
  More than 20 unique and strange characters to interact with! (I really like the
  jellyfish personally)
  .
  A spectacular original soundtrack!
  .
  Lots of plants
  .
  Umm
  .
  Phone calls!
  .
  Puzzles!
  .
  Knots!
  .
  The most evil bad guy in the history of evil bad guys
  .
  Anime fight scene!
  .
  Our boys in blue!
  .
  And of course, a duck.
  .
  WHOAH WHOAH WHOAH ENOUGH WITH THE JOKES What is all this about even
  .
  Clam Man is a point'n'click adventure game, with an emphasis on story rather
  than puzzles. We wanted to create a game focused on the parts we loved about old
  school adventure games - the story and the jokes. It's a simple, entertaining
  game where you explore the world and interact with it's inhabitants. Oh, and we
  did throw a few puzzles in here and there, too.
  .
  IS THE CLAM MAN FOR ME?
  .
  I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a pretty cool person. I'll just ask a
  couple questions to figure that out:
  .
  Do you enjoy story-driven games?
  .
  Do you enjoy absurd and strange comedy?
  .
  Do you want to relax and play a game where the primary objective is to make you
  laugh at said strange comedy?
  .
  Have you got a thing for ridiculous underwater settings and weird, nonsensical
  stories?
  .
  well yeah you know in that case it's definitely for you
  .
  Much love,
  .

publisher: Technical Grimoire Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Available in Print y en Espanol.
  .
  Clink is a tabletop RPG about drifters, the creeds that bring them together, and
  the history that drives them apart. This game uses coins to tell a story
  inspired by spaghetti westerns, ronin tales, and shows like Firefly or
  Supernatural.
  .
  72 Pages, Color Softcover, 5.5"x8.5" Book.
  .
  Your past is a mystery, but your Creed drives you forward.
  .
  Characters begin as rough sketches of the shifty sort you'd see in an old
  Western or Noir film. They all start as blank slates, their histories unknown.
  Tell stories about their past and create your character as you play.
  .
  Clink tells a non-linear story, crisscrossing between your characters'
  flashbacks and the risky business of the day.
  .
  "We had a hilarious and memorable time. We'll be playing again soon! 5 Stars! I
  can't say it enough. 5 Stars!" - Nate L.
  .
  "If you want a simple game that you can play for a few hours, are new to
  tabletops, or perhaps trying to get a friend to try - I highly recommend this."
  - Conrad A.
  .
  Make your mark on frontiers both familiar and bizarre.
  .
  Clink includes three starting scenarios to kick off your adventures. Each
  scenario contains a quick background, a few example creeds, and 5 characters so
  your group can jump right in.
  .
  RUSTBARREL: A thriving frontier town caught between a corrupt silver miners and
  murderous outlaws.
  .
  TIANGONG: Once the pride of the stars, the space station has fallen to neglect
  and crime.
  .
  DARKGORGE: Ever since the double eclipse in December of 1880, the monsters
  haven't stopped coming.
  .
  It's a flexible system that can support nearly any setting, so long as there's
  room for folks who aim to misbehave (six-shooters and door-kickin's encouraged
  too).
  .
  Spend coins to shape your past, or flip them to determine your future.
  .
  By spending hard-earned coins, the player is able to reveal more and more of
  their Drifter's personality through flashbacks and stories. But sometimes those
  flashbacks will bring up painful memories, burdening your Character with Scars.
  .
  When push comes to shove in Clink, it's time to start flipping coins. A "heads"
  gets you what you're going for, but every "tails" sends you deeper and deeper
  into trouble.

  Harness the power of nature to overgrow lo-fi scenes of urban decay and
  manufactured landscapes. Create small plant-covered dioramas of brutalism and
  beauty by planting seeds, repurposing hundreds of discarded objects and creating
  unique structures for nature to reclaim.
  .
  Dive into a relaxing sandbox mode with no goals, or take on a multi-chapter
  "campaign" where the task is to strike a balance between the natural and the
  manufactured. Adding objects will encourage lush vegetation to grow, but each
  object must be covered in foliage in order to proceed.
  .
  Cloud Gardens hovers somewhere in between a sandbox toy and a game with
  challenges. Partly a gardening simulator, partly a dystopian landscape builder,
  and partly a puzzle game that is both satisfying and without frustration. It is
  a relaxing experience that takes you from one scene to the next while
  encouraging creativity and coming up with your own solutions.
  .
  This is a chill game where the primary goal is to delight in your own
  creativity. Players can download looping videos of their completed dioramas and
  share them with other gardeners from across the internet, and our Discord server
  has a lively community of gardeners.
  .
  Solve organic puzzles in a serene 3D space.
  .
  Create to your heart's content in creative mode.
  .
  Unlock an enormous catalogue of objects and plantlife.
  .
  Share your creations.

  remember your first solo shopping trip?

  co-open is a game about a kid's first time buying groceries on their own. Looks
  like it's time to explore and have some fun!
  .
  a classic loaf of rye bread, some birthday cards, and kompot
  .
  The products available in the local cooperatively run store are community-
  selected, trying to suit everybody's needs. You might not find everything you're
  expecting, but maybe there will be something that surprises you! Check the
  information on product price tags to make sure you only pick fresh local
  produce, call your grandmother for a suggestion, or just go with whatever
  catches your eye! Just try not to feed the store cats off the shelves. Please.
  They are fed regularly.
  .
  anything else?
  .
  You can get your ice cream and veggies in a few minutes to rush back home sooner
  - or stray away from the shelves and find yourself a part of a drawing class in
  the rooftop park, or an underground snowskating hangout! Don't be scared to
  check things out.
  .
  making memories
  .
  Looks like your neighbor friend is also shopping today! But could you meet
  anybody else? What if it's a very (very) big crow, or a mysterious vent dweller?
  Maybe you will even get to keep some meaningful mementos from your adventures!
  .
  so, how was your day?

  your shopping trip - or, more importantly, about your product picks?

  Remember those lovable-cheap "20 (or 40 or 50 or 100) Games For Windows" CD-
  ROM's that were available everywhere in the 1990's?
  .
  Well, I wrote a lot of those games. If you bought one of those $9.95 CD-ROM
  discount packs from Expert or Cosmi, you have probably played my games. And now
  those games seem to be available in a lot of those "abandonware" sites for free
  download, despite the fact that I still own all the rights.
  .
  If you liked those old games, and you actually want to own 'em legally, you're
  in luck, because I've packaged FIFTY of my old games in a brand new "Retro
  Pack". It's just like your old "Super Amazing Games for Windows 95", except it
  actually runs on newer stuff.
  .
  The Retro Pack has arcade games! You can test your sushi-eating and squid-
  avoidance with Suzy Sushi. You can hone your skills defeating aliens in Invaders
  From Neptune and Zap Pod. You can dodge crazy drivers in Head On Collision or
  blast enemy tanks in Think Tank. There is even an oddball arcade version of
  Poker!
  .
  You may have played the old standard card solitaire and dice games a million
  times, but have you tried Siege, Vanishing Cross, Kizbot or Brain Bones? The
  Code Zone Retro Pack has some interesting new games that you will enjoy learning
  and (hopefully) winning.
  .
  The Retro Pack has several fun board games. Whether it is classic stuff like
  Backgammon or Moku, or if you want a new kind of challenge with PangKi or
  Engulf, the Retro Pack has what you need.
  .
  If your brain needs some exercise, the Retro Pack has brain benders! If you like
  word games, there are some great Cryptograms. If logic puzzles are what you need
  to keep your brain trained, you can test your skills in Deductive Logic.
  Finally, if you think you know everything about how to beat Tic-Tac-Toe, see how
  well you do in 3D!
  .
  And to top it all off, every game has plenty of variations and options
  available, so you can change the challenge once you think you have mastered the

game: Codemancer (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/C/Codemancer (USA)/Codemancer (USA).json
developer: Important Little Games
publisher: Important Little Games
genre: Educational;Puzzle
description:
  **UPDATE** Mac & PC Builds now have translated text in Spanish, French, German
  and the original English!
  .
  Codemancer brings the mystery of magic and the exhilaration of learning to code
  together in a fantasy universe that uses spell casting as a way to teach and
  learn programming skills. Codemancer's fantasy universe is filled with rival
  sorcerers and their minions for players to encounter along their journey.
  Codemancer is a non-violent, entertaining, and educational game designed to be
  inclusive and accessible to learners at any stage. Features include a gender-
  neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and a
  programming interface that's designed to be easy to understand by kids with
  varying degrees of skill and experience. Codemancer breaks down barriers that
  may have discouraged some kids from embracing technology and elevates their
  screentime to be more productive and entertaining.  It isn't a typical coding or
  technology game.
  .
  WHAT IS CODEMANCER ALL ABOUT?
  .
  Codemancer tells a moving story about Aurora, a young, creatively talented girl
  who's trying to grow up, become independent, and do good in the world in the
  face of incredible obstacles when her father is suddenly kidnapped. Aurora has
  to embark on an adventure to save him as she grows into a gracious and
  independent young woman. She must learn magic spells to save her father, but the
  magic used in Aurora's world works the same as programming does in ours. Inspire
  children to explore their potential as they discover the magic of coding.
  .
  CODEMANCER IS AN EDUCATIONAL GAMING ADVENTURE:
  .
  Codemancer is designed for 6 to 12 year olds as an educational game that teaches
  the magic behind coding-and can be fun for grownups, too!
  .
  CODEMANCER SPECIFICALLY TEACHES:
  .
  Sequential Algorithms
  .
  Debugging
  .
  Function Arguments
  .
  Scope
  .
  Looping Constructs
  .
  Concurrent Programming
  .
  ...AND TEACHES IN GENERAL:
  .
  Computational Thinking
  .
  Planning
  .
  Problem Solving
  .
  Resilience
  .
  CODEMANCER FEATURES:
  .
  A narrative inspired by popular works of young adult fantasy worlds such as
  Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Neverending Story, The Last Airbender, and many
  more!
  .
  Gameplay that takes place in a hexagonal world, making it easy to estimate
  distances and angles by eye.
  .
  'Freeze time' ability, so players can debug the programs they've written and
  potentially code their way out of a jam to learn from their mistakes.
  .
  Availability for PC, Mac, iPad, and Android tablets.
  .
  CODEMANCER IS STRUCTURED FOR ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSIVITY:
  .
  The goal of Codemancer is to be as broadly inclusive as possible by creating a
  gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone,
  and language interface that's designed to make the game appeal to kids at
  different skill levels.
  .
  Codemancer breaks down barriers that can hinder some kids from feeling
  comfortable with engaging with programming, for example Codemancer uses pips
  (like on a die) instead of numerals, and sets the gameplay in a hexagonal world
  that makes it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye.
  .
  No syntax errors -- if you can enter a spell, it will run. Syntax errors can be
  frustrating and cause learners to quit before they really begin.
  .
  Codemancer uses an open dyslexic font, where letters are designed to look
  distinctly different from each other to make reading easier for kids with
  dyslexia.
  .
  The game is fully voiced, so reading is completely optional.
  .
  Codemancer's programming language is designed to be accessible, but also
  translates easily to a variety of popular real-world programming languages (such
  as Python).
  .
  Codemancer appeals to many educational groups, from children with special needs
  for reading, to younger children new to coding, to older children with more
  advanced coding and programming skill sets.
  .
  Codemancer has the potential to reach under-represented groups in coding and
  teach them an often-exclusionary, but nonetheless important, 20th-century skill.

  Collateral Thinking - No Fix Is Quicker!
  .
  Collateral Thinking DX is an arcade-style action platformer that's all about
  beating up alien ghosts and recovering blueprints on a tight schedule (and
  budget) to save the true victims - billionaires!
  .
  Each level is a self-contained screen that gives you one of four specific tasks
  to complete in 30 short seconds - to "Avoid" the hazards, to "Beat" the enemies,
  to "Collect" the blueprints, or to "Defeat" the one of the fiendish bosses.
  These quickfire challenges force you to quickly survey your surroundings and
  then jump into action in order to progress through the 100+ floors and net as
  much cash as possible along the way. You can climb Spearmint Tower solo, or
  bring along a friend to share in the frustration!
  .
  The game starts with the core floor-climbing, obstacle-negotiation of Donkey
  Kong and piles on the original Mario Bros.' single-screen management, and then
  cranks up the speed for slippier, sloppier silliness. With over 100 levels,
  unlockable characters, multiplayer action, and toe-tapping tunes, Collateral
  Thinking DX is more than ready to satisfy your arcade addiction!

publisher: Jon Lemich
genre: Role Playing
description:
  The Colors of Magic is a light, collaborative, story-focused, fantasy tabletop
  RPG about a group of wizard friends.  The game focuses on the characters'
  beliefs and relationships.
  .
  This game uses some ideas I've wanted to test for a long time:
  .
  GM "Mad Lib"-style adventure planning built around structured character creation
  focused on conflicts and relationships as your "stats."
  .
  Giving players full authorial control over the broad strokes of the antagonists,
  conflicts, themes, and setting.
  .
  Calling the GM the "gamerunner" and the PCs the "protagonist characters"
  .
  Specifically incorporating non-playing audience members.
  .
  Really taking advantage of the Script Change safety tool and integrating it
  throughout the game.
  .
  Choosing the outcome of risky actions rather than using a randomizer; focusing
  on balancing the game's outcome choices rather than combat and PC abilities.
  .
  The Colors of Magic was originally written as a submission for the Our Little
  Foods Game Jam, which gave me an opportunity to write a game about choosing your
  outcomes.  It's meant as a way to introduce the ideas, above; but it's a
  playable game!  Now, as of May 15, 2021, the game has been updated with all-new
  art and "real" layout!
  .
  Email colorsofmagic@runagame.net with all the typos and errors you find.  Also
  with any thoughts, experiences, etc. you have playing.  I welcome your feedback!

developer: Mega_Corp

genre: Role Playing;Survival
description:
  The Company is a corporate survival horror RPG about capitalistic meddling
  and greed set against a backdrop of industrial disaster. Players take on the
  roles of specialists in the Wuhan-Baxter Corporations ARC division, a private
  emergency response and containment unit. W-B ARC teams are deployed to
  company holdings under duress in order to assess and contain any situation
  without alerting local or national authorities. As the company is on the
  cutting edge of technology in virtually every industry, its holdings are...
  varied. ARC teams face the aftermath of company experiments gone wrong,
  unstable constructs breaking down and creatures both otherworldly and
  manufactured being turned loose.
  .
  The ARC division employs the following types of specialists:
  .
  * Soldiers - Private Military Contractors
  .
  * Scientists - Field Researchers
  .
  * Medics - Combat Veteran Physicians
  .
  * Technicians - Digital Network Gurus
  .
  * Engineers - Structural Emergency Experts
  .
  Soldier, Scientist, Medic, Technician, and Engineer
  .
  Using a simple d10 system, employees investigate and secure company
  facilities, pushing themselves both mentally and physically while racking
  up stress as missions progress. Too much stress may cause employees to
  burnout dangerously, endangering themselves and the rest of their team.
  However, by doing their jobs and pushing forward, employees can earn
  company loyalty which can be used to offset further burnout, relieve
  stress, and even secure promotions, furthering their skills.
  .
  All of this is administered by the Game Manager. Using countdown clocks
  and dice-lite mechanics, GMs ratchet up the tension as ARC teams begin
  to break down in the face of the unknown.
  .
  The rules and guidelines to run and play The Company span two small
  volumes: The Employee Handbook and The Management Manual.

  Intentionally ending your turn early and letting the bacteria grow lets you
  research stronger antibiotics

  All bacteria lose one health per turn
  .
  Any bacteria without neighbors die the next turn
  .
  Every isolated bacteria gains you bonus points
  .
  Each extra dose at the end of the game earns you bonus points

  palette and satisfying interactions in every corner. The music is soothing and
  relaxing to listen to while you battle the unending bacterial proliferation.

  Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! is the massive sequel to the surprise best selling
  original, one of the few games that gives players complete control on how they
  want to build their restaurant.
  .
  The game starts like any other morning at SherriSoda Tower as you take the
  elevator up to open Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a platinum star restaurant that was
  surging in popularity thanks to your amazing chef and management skills. Just
  then, a swarm of police surround SherriSoda Tower. It seems the SherriSoda head
  executives were secretly stealing funds from the company at the same time they
  were incurring a staggering amount of debt, draining the accounts of the tower
  and several of the businesses inside of it, including CSD. Just like that, the
  tower was closed and put up for federal auction, including everything inside of
  it. It was all over... the Cook, Serve, Delicious! restaurant was no more.
  .
  Angry but determined to rebuild, you've scrounged up all of your personal life's
  savings and bought commercial space inside the Teragon Supertower, the largest
  skyscraper in the city. It's here that you will start a brand new Cook, Serve,
  Delicious! restaurant, build it back to its former glory, and rebuild your
  legacy as the best chef in the world.
  .
  Features include:
  .
  A 60+ hour experience as you build your restaurant from a roach infested eatery
  to a World Class Platinum Star experience by either running your own restaurant
  or branching out as a chef for hire, where you take jobs within the tower and
  various restaurants as you gain experience with the large array of foods, which
  spans 400 levels across 33 restaurants!
  .
  Several modes including Classic Mode that brings back the classic gameplay of
  the original, Stress mode that instantly rockets the difficulty to the highest
  setting, and Zen mode, which allows you to take it easy and relaxes many of the
  stressful elements to provide an easy day of cooking.
  .
  All new gameplay features and additions, with a greater flexibility of
  difficulty for those who like it casual or insanely difficult.
  .
  Over 200 foods, sides, drinks and desserts to choose from, a staggering increase
  from the 30 foods in the original game.
  .
  New local co-op mode! The all new split screen co-op feature allows you to play
  through the entire game with two players, with the ability for players to drop
  in and out during your progress within the game.
  .
  Tons of lore including an email system with over 600 emails, unlockable secrets,
  and tons more!
  .
  Unlock over 1,200 restaurant objects and design your restaurant however you'd
  like with the Designer mode.

  Welcome to Costume Fairy Adventures, a game about fairies.
  .
  In costumes.
  .
  Having adventures.
  .
  (Fairies are not good at creative titles.)
  .
  From enchanted forests to star-faring spaceships, and even to your own backyard,
  fairies can be found just about anywhere - and where fairies go, shenanigans are
  sure to follow! Drawing magic from the power of mischief, fairies can turn the
  world upside-down with whimsical wishes and preternatural pranks - and when
  their usual tricks aren't enough, new talents are only a change of clothes away.
  .
  Costume Fairy Adventures is an improvisational roleplaying game for 2 to 7
  players. Gather your friends and a handful of six-sided dice and take on the
  role of a fairy of your very own. With lightning-fast character creation, over
  100 ready-to-wear costumes courtesy of the Core Costume Deck, and a whole passel
  of pregenerated pranking patsies - including fuddled philosophers, solicitous
  spiders, and gnefarious gnomish gnecromancers - you'll be ready for mischief in
  mere minutes.
  .
  What are you waiting for? Adventure awaits!
  .

  Outwit gravity, race the clock, explore new worlds.
  .
  This is a gravity-based arcade game inspired by classics like Lunar Lander and
  Space Taxi. You'll pilot your craft from pad to pad trying to beat your best
  time - then flirt with that fine line between speed and control.
  .
  If you're brave enough to try Hard Mode you'll be flopping around like a QWOPy,
  low gravity turtle. With a little practice you'll be zippin' around doin' barrel
  rolls. You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Oculus Rift.
  .
  You'll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics - bizarre organic
  shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas.
  You'll also find a variety of physics-based obstacles and challenges to test
  your piloting skills. Each level is a hand-crafted landscape that encourages the
  player to explore - and goof around!
  .
  Version 3 now available with new levels, new options menu, improved VR support,
  fresh sound effects.
  .
  Version 2.5 includes 10 new levels, new particle effects, smoother physics, new
  progress tracker - dozens of changes and improvements.

developer: OrionQK
publisher: OrionQK
genre: Role Playing
description:
  The Creature Comes for Us is a game that can be played solo or multiplayer which
  uses a standard deck of cards, two six-sided dice, and the players' imagination.
  .
  You play as a group of people preparing to fight against a currently unknown
  threat. You will learn (through drawing cards) about the creature that is coming
  for you, you will find resources and tactics to fight against them, and you will
  learn more about the unique traits and talents of the player characters. The
  second part of the game brings together what you've gathered to fight the
  looming horrors and you will find out if your characters and world can survive
  the onslaught.
  .
  The game can be used for a standard one-shot game with friends or for world-
  building and character-building purposes to slot into other systems. A finished
  game can leave you with a well-developed world in which to set a post-
  apocalyptic game for another RPG, or with ruins and a story for a future
  adventuring party to explore.
  .
  The download includes two versions. Both have been designed by an accessibility
  consultant to work on screen readers however the plain text version is
  specifically created with a range of visual accessibility needs in mind.
  .
  Recommended: 2-5 players or as solo game. 2-3 hours to play. No GM (game master)
  is required to play.

  Lead Your Followers Into the Future!
  .
  Your word is gospel in this god sim set in Sub-Saharan Africa. Influence and try
  to control your followers using commandments but beware, free will leaves these
  open to interpretation. Will you create a flourishing civilization or lead them
  to death and destruction?
  .
  About This Game
  .
  Welcome to Crest, a unique take on the traditional god sim, where your word is
  gospel. Control and guide your followers by issuing commandments written in an
  evolving pictographic language.
  .
  How these commandments are interpreted and remembered is not set in stone. What
  you communicate and what experiences your followers have with the environment is
  the basis for their religion. Over time, commandments can develop different
  associations and completely change their meaning. After all, your followers
  still have free will and will sometimes do what they think is best for them,
  regardless of what you had in mind.
  .
  The consequences of your actions may not always be clear and you will need to be
  aware of the ever-changing environment, your people's beliefs and their feelings
  about you.
  .
  Will they love, respect or fear you?
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Create your own religion, nurture your followers and observe how they evolve, or
  die, as a result of your decisions - including the unintended consequences of
  your commands!
  .
  Sandbox-style gameplay: Oversee a world where weather, vegetation, mineral
  deposits, drought and animal behavior will create surprises
  .
  Weave your own stories through trial and error. The history of your people will
  be chronicled and presented to you at the end of your vigil using the in-game
  storybuilder.
  .
  Progress by unlocking new words, increasing the complexity of your commandments
  .
  Customize the difficulty of your games with various amounts of resources,
  animals, islands and overall island quality
  .
  Built-in Twitch support: When you live-stream the game on Twitch, your viewers
  can join your cities and vote on commandments to help or disrupt your godly
  plans
  .
  Setting
  .
  Crest is an Afrofuturist game that reimagines how humanity arose in the cradle
  of humankind on the African continent. It's a historical themed game that tries
  to emulate an advanced iron age civilization that could have existed a few
  thousand years ago. The setting for the game world, its flora and fauna is based
  on African biomes, with rainfall determining the tug-of-war between desert,
  savanna and jungle.
  .
  Progression and Losing
  .
  Every new world you start is unique and will write its own stories. If all your
  followers die, that world is gone forever. However, you will still be able to
  view the legacy of your previous worlds. As long as your people live you can
  continue playing and further shape your own history by creating more and more
  complex commandments with newly unlocked words.

  This retro-inspired 2D Action RPG might outright surprise you. CrossCode
  combines 16-bit SNES-style graphics with butter-smooth physics, a fast-paced
  combat system, and engaging puzzle mechanics, served with a gripping sci-fi
  story.
  .
  CrossCode is all about how it plays! That's why there is a free demo! Go give it
  a try!
  .
  Take the best out of two popular genres, find a good balance between them and
  make a great game. That's what CrossCode does. And it works pretty well. You get
  the puzzles of Zelda-esque dungeons and are rewarded with the great variety of
  equipment you know and love from RPGs. During the fast-paced battles you will
  use the tools you find on your journey to reveal and exploit the enemies'
  weaknesses and at the same time will be able to choose equipment and skills for
  a more in-depth approach in fighting your enemies.
  .
  Check the Reviews (On Steam, GOG, Gamejolt, heck all over the net!) to see who
  loves the game. We're sure you will, too!

description:
  Across the twisting sea of fates, a glance catches yours and sets your heart
  aflame. You reach your hand out only to feel the weight of heaven disappearing
  beneath you, sending you hurtling down and down and down. You see their eyes,
  feel the threads wrapped around your hearts growing tighter as you fall. Your
  bodies will change. Your names, memories, and lives as well. But you will meet
  again. And again. And again. As many times as it takes to reach each other.
  .
  Crossing the Seven Stars is a 2-player game about useless lesbians mutually
  pining for each other across lifetimes, unable to muster the courage to confess
  first. The game is played over the course of 7 Lifetimes, with the final one
  containing the inevitable confession.
  .
  Probably the only game on Itch to ask you to go out and play 5 other people's
  games.

  thousand opportunities to klutz yourself into a pit of spikes.
  .
  TEXT-INTERFACED TERMINALS
  .
  I'm in love with the image of a game and a terminal side-by-side, and I finally
  got it working in Cruel World-- HACK, MINE, and KISS various objects in order to
  be allowed to save your game, to unlock doors to otherwise inaccessible places,
  and to read descriptions of the mechanics of the game itself.
  .
  A PERSISTENT WORLD THAT CAN ONLY GET WORSE
  .
  A singular, shared server records your accomplishments and your every selfish
  action.
  .
  Will you protect yourself from the selfish actions of other players by taking
  selfish actions yourself, or will you keep faith and fight the good fight, no
  matter the personal consequences?
  .
  We all know the world is dying, but who will take the blame?
  .
  THE WORLD ALREADY ENDED, LET'S THROW A HUGE PARTY
  .
  The world has already been ruined by OWNERS -- it's time to take it back. Throw
  a PARTY at a private node, and everyone gets access as long as the PARTY keeps

  we don't know, er, there's, um, there's a bit of a situation with the crypt...
  yeah, I think we broke something. Sorry. Can you fix it?"
  .
  The Basics:
  .
  Every card serves dual purposes. If you explore a card as a tile on the map, it
  will trigger an Event Effect. However, if you instead draw the card as an item,
  you can use that card at any time to trigger an Item Effect. The map and the
  deck swap places every floor, so be careful about what you discard, because
  it'll come back as a map tile on the next floor!
  .
  A solo TTRPG / boardgame, made with inspiration from various roguelike games.
  Learn the game's systems and use them to your advantage!

  .
  supporters on patreon ($3+) can get this game for free! your support will help
  me make more of the sorts of games I've got here on itch. (fair warning: most
  are not TTRPGs, they're generally puzzle games, arcade games, and experimental

developer: minotalen

genre: Puzzle;Strategy
description:
  You are a robot tasked with producing crystals.  Organize a never ending supply
  of them and see how long you can last!
  .
  Controls:
  .
  arrow keys/wasd:
  .
  places/grows/cracks a crystal if possible
  .
  grow/crack crystals by stacking crystals of the same color
  .
  moves that don't use crystal discharge your jump instead (cursor turns red)
  .
  you start with a jump (white cursor) and recharge it when you crack a crystal
  .
  space/x (action):
  .
  charge jump, move the preview to the next crystal
  .
  at position 3, action moves the preview back to position 1
  .
  the heart cost for moving the preview back down increases (1-2-3-3...)
  .
  useful when you get stuck, but comes at a cost
  .
  u/z (undo):
  .
  you can undo all moves that don't generate a new color
  .
  click on the digit 3 to disable arcade mode (enables undo for all moves)
  .
  r (reset):
  .
  used to restart at any point (careful, can't be undone)
  .
  mouse:
  .
  tap next to the player to move to that cell
  .
  tapping on the active piece preview triggers action
  .
  Hints:
  .
  the more of these you read, the less you get to figure out yourself (SPOILERS
  AHEAD)
  .
  try to keep your jump for a move sequence that cracks a crystal, since that
  recharges your jump
  .
  crystals with neighbors of the same color are more likely to require a jump to
  leave from, try to keep the neighbors distinct
  .
  alternating between jumping and cracking crystals (then jumping to the next
  crystal to crack) can get you far
  .
  if you reach 5 hearts you will trigger a crystal anomaly (not easy)
  .

developer: Virtually Competent
publisher: Virtually Competent
genre: Action
description:
  The crystals return!
  .
  Crystal Control II is the follow-up to one of our most successful releases. The
  original game, released in 2014, was a competitive game for two local players
  with some bullet hell elements. Because that core gameplay seemed to resonate so
  well with the fans, we decided to stick pretty closely to the original formula
  for the sequel...but with some interesting new twists!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Local multiplayer action for two! Fight for control of the crystals to gain more
  firepower and take out your opponent...you only need to get one hit on them to
  win!
  .
  Easy to learn, hard to master! We've seen players of all skill levels pick up
  the game and understand it's simple controls. Don't let the simplicity fool you,
  though! The skill ceiling can be quite high, giving room for the competitive
  folks to shine.
  .
  Eight playable characters! Each character has different movement speeds, charge
  shots, and "Control" abilities (which can be executed after capturing more than
  half of the total crystals on-screen)!
  .
  Solo practice mode! Crystal Control II was designed from the ground up as a
  competitive game for two players, but if you don't have a friend nearby you can
  still enjoy our new target practice mode. try to get a high score on every
  stage!
  .
  This game is best enjoyed with one or more gamepads!
  .
  Crystal Control II is best played with two gamepads, but the game also includes
  two alternate modes if you only have one (keyboard vs gamepad or shared single
  gamepad).
  .
  Unfortunately, it's impossible to play the Versus mode of Crystal Control II
  with keyboard only. Most keyboards have a limit on simultaneous key presses that
  is much too low for the number of keys Crystal Control II would require (which
  means that key presses would be dropped randomly and create unfair matches).
  .
  Solo Mode, however, is playable with either a gamepad or a keyboard.

  release, and I am currently working on the next episode after Awakening. I
  constantly update my devlog and the official twitter Originally, this was known
  as the "PREVIEW VERSION", but I felt like this was a great intro to the series,
  so I decided to let it stand on its own! :D

  Author's Notes
  .
  This material has a general content warning for depictions and allusions to
  violence and psychological manipulation. Unlike similar games, CDG steps away
  from references to sanity and insanity but it does deal with stress related
  dysfunction and issues of work-life balance. I reserve the right to update these
  files periodically with new material. Follow my account for updates.
  .
  ______________________________________________
  .
  Inspirations
  .
  The fictional premise of CDG is heavily inspired by the Call of Cthulhu
  roleplaying game, published by Chaosium, as well as Delta Green, by Arc Dream
  Publishing. I encourage you to check out and support both games!
  .
  And, as stated above, CDG is a hack of Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley designed
  with the intent to expand the fictional scope and allow for more direct campaign
  play. You can support Graham on DriveThru right here!

  .
  About This Adventure
  .
  The Curse of Dread Pirate Zarr is a short adventure made for table top role
  playing games (think DnD, Pathfinder, & Troika).
  .
  The Elevator Pitch
  .
  This adventure concerns the strange events happening in Brinewater, a cool water
  port on one of the more popular merchant routes through the region.  For the
  past couple of months, merchant ships sailing into the area have been harassed
  and tricked by a mysterious force. The city itself has experienced strange bouts
  of heavy fog seeping into sections of the city, and frightened denizens speak of
  seeing ominous forms and shadows playing across the mist. The party has just
  arrived in the city of Brinewater, but are they willing to uncover the truth
  behind the Curse of Dread Pirate Zarr?
  .
  System Agnostic
  .
  The adventure is flexible to any ttrpg system and to any level adventuring
  party. Why is that? Because the battles are less about enemy stats and more
  about how they act. This gives you the flexibility to change the difficulty as
  needed.
  .
  This adventure PDF is created with phones in mind. That means it's created in
  1080x1920 vertical format, and it supports interactive elements/bookmarking.
  Tired of having to flip through a PDF that's not made for your phone? Problem
  solved. If there's enough support I will also offer a traditional PDF in the
  future.
  .
  So What Do I Get?
  .
  If you just want the phone PDF, it's 31 full color pages of adventure (think
  like 10-15 normal pages). It is illustrated and formatted and I think it looks
  pretty damn good.
  .
  If you buy the deluxe version (pay $8 or more), you get the phone PDF as well as
  the full size battle maps at 300dpi and 140dpi (for virtual table tops). The
  maps come in gridded and ungridded options.
  .
  -Town of Brinewater Map
  .
  -Docks Battlemap
  .
  -Admiral's Quarters
  .
  -Hangman's Point Battlemap
  .
  Support TTRPG Adventures on Itch
  .
  In case you weren't aware, artists get a better deal when they sell a ttrpg
  project on itch than if they sell on another big ttrpg site. Supporting us indie
  ttrpg creators here means we can make more content you can use at your
  adventuring table.
  .
  Thank you and I hope you enjoy it!

developer: Parts Per Million
publisher: Parts Per Million
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Triplanetary and First Lensman were the first two novels in the classic Lensman
  series of books by E. E. "Doc" Smith, the father of Space Opera as a genre. This
  book takes the public domain text of those first two novels and turns them into
  a solo roleplaying resource, using the Cut Up technique.
  .
  Cut Up Solo is a technique that uses random snippets of text that you pick and
  fit together, creating what the GM says to you. You can then respond to that,
  and then the cycle repeats. As all the snippets in this set all come from the
  same author, and series of books, it gives a sense of continuity.
  .
  Cut up play is very different from more traditional oracle-driven solo play. If
  you struggle with how to interpret word pairs or prompts, cut up could be for
  you.
  .
  These stories contain over 148,000 words of text, chopped into snippets of 4 or
  5 words. You get over 35,000 snippets to mix and match in your solo games. The
  PDF contains two d1000 tables of snippets, and the spreadsheets contain the full
  set of snippets.
  .
  A print version of this book is available on my website.

  Summary:
  .
  This is a booklet detailing the construction and operation of one sided dice for
  use in a setting agnostic tabletop RPG system.
  .
  It might seem silly to play an RPG that only uses one sided dice, but in
  practice...
  .
  ...it is indeed quite silly.
  .
  Why a D1?
  .
  Legends tell of a die that is perfectly weighted, with any face having the exact
  same chance of being rolled. A die that removes all chance from the equation.
  Only a skilled crafts-person could construct such a marvelous die, correct? It
  would certainly seem that way, especially when taking into account the most
  wondrous feature of this object: it only has one side. In truth though, you can
  make one in under 10 minutes, using materials you (almost certainty) already own
  and with only the most basic crafting skills.
  .
  What you get:
  .
  8 pages (counting covers), black and white, zine format, 1 sheet of paper. Just
  print, assemble, and play!
  .
  Jam Notes:
  .
  While I started this game before the Jam, the "Bad Tabletop RPGs Jam" and this
  tweet's focus on absurd die face counts reminded me of my unfinished draft of
  this game, motivating me to finish it.

  A Mystery Unfolds
  .
  When the latest exhibit of the New Magma City Art Museum has its grand opening,
  it doesn't take long until people are going missing. And new, undocumented
  paintings start showing up in the collection... so well made, it feels like you
  could get lost in those worlds forever.
  .
  When the ordinary New Magma City penguin police force can't make nor heads nor
  tails out of this supernatural case, the ragtag band of teenage private
  investigators over at Daemon Detectives, Inc. gets called in to save the day
  once again!

  Fight Your Inner Daemons
  .
  Daemon Detective Gaiden 2 is an action platformer where you fight enemies and

  .
  Coins obtained in the levels can be spent on a variety of powerups to help even
  the odds, and every character has an unique ability that alters their gameplay
  style drastically.

  As you defeat the bosses of each world, you gradually piece together not only
  the final boss' lair, but also the dark history behind its creation...

  Break the Sound Barrier
  .
  A spin-off crossover racing game featuring your favorite characters from Daemon
  Detective, Shattered World, Gun Princess, and Final Columbus. Travel at speeds
  over 200 mph on futuristic twisted racetracks hovering miles above massive
  megacities, cursed ruins, untamed wildernesses, and abstract otherworlds!
  .
  Chain together jump boosts and slide boosts to keep your momentum going, or use
  silly cartoon weapons to swipe victory at the last second! Try your best to stay
  on the track - easier said than done - and use the power of gravity to reach
  unfathomable speeds! Are you the fastest detective alive? There's only one way
  to find out!
  .
  Features
  .
  '90s style arcade racing without cutscenes, long loading times, or
  microtransactions!
  .
  5 cups for a total of 30 racetracks! Revisit classic areas like Crystal Tokyo
  Zone, the Painted Shadow Gallery, or Dracula's Clock Tower in glorious low-poly
  3D!
  .
  Support for local multiplayer with up to 4 players at once!
  .
  30 playable characters with different stats! Pick the character that matches
  your playstyle the best, or just roll with someone you think looks cool!
  .
  Adaptive AI that gives you a fair chance, but still will give you a run for your
  money if you're going for that elusive gold medal!
  .
  Use XInput gamepads out of the box with no setup required! Or cram 4 players
  around the same keyboard for an awkward, sweaty experience!
  .
  Skill-based, momentum-based gameplay that lets you avoid all weapons if you're
  good enough at dodging, and hit speeds much higher than your normal max speed if
  you're good at chaining boosts together!
  .
  You can move so fast you don't even need to drive on the track anymore! It was
  always more of a recommendation than a rule, anyway.
  .
  N64/PS2-style low-poly graphics in smooth 60fps!
  .
  You can play as Dracula or a penguin!
  .
  Nice music!
  .
  Actual sound effects!

  I ran out of cool stuff to put on this list!

developer: charon@ss

genre: Role Playing
description:
  This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper Agency boss and
  editor. The world it takes place in is a dark and haunted one, with ghosts,
  zombies, monsters and even shapeshifting murderers, pretending to be human after
  they have stolen their victims' bodies or infiltrated the humanity. It was
  inspired heavily by the works of H.P.Lovecraft and it builds on the atmosphere
  of uncertainty and noir of the 1940s.
  .
  Send your sextet of weathered journalists, detectives and occult specialists to
  investigate murder, affair, and horror in the Town.
  .
  Each time, the story will be different. Sometimes, a werewolf is shredding
  innocent (and less innocent) victims to pieces and it is your task to unmask the
  creature. Other times, it will be a body stealing alien from outer space, a
  mummy that some misfortunate archeologist has excavated and is now haunting
  them. Perhaps it will be Jack the Ripper, still mysteriously alive and lurking
  in the streets at night.
  .
  Or maybe there is a really bad big tentacled monster hidden in the cellar of the
  University?
  .
  It is for you to find out and entertain your readers while bravely standing up
  against ancient evil.

  artificial intelligence A.I.O.N.E., who took over the control causing the

  .
  The time has come. Step out from the shadows to face this new enemy in open
  battle.
  .
  Soon the A.I. will have to learn how dangerous the Scavengers are.
  .
  The evil A.I. brings doom upon the world. A group of outcasts - the Scavengers -

  full of great treasures... or broken scrap.
  .

  coming. You'll be going up and out of the underground to seek new horizons and
  possibilities.

  Become one of the outcasts and set out on a risky hunt in search of liberation
  and countless riches hidden on the huge skyscrapers. The danger is so great that
  every Scavenger can change the course of history forever... or become another
  forgotten scrap hunter. Choose your path wisely - bigger risks means bigger
  reward!
  .
  Dynamic risk-reward gameplay: choose your path wisely, face the challenges, and
  become the hero you've always wanted to be! Or... take an easier path and return
  with nothing.

  Collect scrap and craft the equipment out of it. You can customize each weapon
  to your individual needs using the crafting system.
  .
  Unexpected item combinations to discover during your adventures. Design your
  perfect strategy by many trials and errors, obviously resulting in many deaths.
  .
  6 unique Scavengers - each one has their skills and style of dealing with
  problems: stealth, strategy, rapid-fire action, or maybe a mix of them? You
  decide!

  Darkest Wave By DuckManArmy Games
  .
  Darkest Wave is a retro shoot-em up done in bright colors and a unique style
  created solely by Derek "Duckman" Adams. A throwback to the age of a different
  kind of difficult and rewarding videogames. Relentless yet you almost made it.
  Entire game was built on timing of the music and action, Keyboard and Gamepad
  support with rumble. Explosive and addictive.
  .
  Moving toward the government base known as Delta-9, Max Titan pilots his custom
  Ferrari fighter the X-20 to destroy a secret rebel base thought to be creating
  enormous robotic creatures. Fly with him and the X-20 through 5 levels of
  explosive color and sound.
  .
  Were you able to beat it? I've skipped a hard mode and just went to insane.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Darkspace is an immersive sci-fi experience.
  .
  It is the year 2271. Humanity has spread across the solar system, terraforming
  our moon and many others. You are the crew of the freighter ship Triton, bound
  for Earth from a mining colony on Charon at the edge of inhabited space. Though
  the journey takes nearly a decade, you and the rest of the crew will pass most
  of it in the dreamless sleep of your cryogenic pods...
  .
  Five players take on the roles of the crew of the Triton, an ill-fated cargo
  ship alone in dark space.
  .
  The captain, the doctor, the mercenary, the corpo, the synth - one of you is a
  murderer.
  .
  Will you solve the mystery of the Triton before the ship's life support fails?
  .
  Darkspace can be played using  any video conferencing software. The screens that
  will separate you and your fellow crew members are part of the game.
  .
  Unlike most murder mysteries no game master or non-player facilitator is needed.
  Just grab yourself and four friends and you are ready to play. The game file
  includes character backgrounds, secret information, and over an hour of custom
  audio to guide your experience.
  .
  Warning: Darkspace is intended to be an immersive experience that emulates an
  intense and stressful situation.

developer: Io Black, Cryo
publisher: Io Black, Cryo
genre: Visual Novel
description:
  The year is 1995, and you're newly single, ready to mingle... and fresh off the
  plane in Stradania, the dysfunctional micronation whose chief exports are pig
  iron, human misery, and radioactive souvenir mugs.
  .
  Your travel guides have steered you to the hottest nightclub in town. Now it's
  up to you to seize the evening by getting up close and intimate with Stradania's
  Most Eligible Vaguely Handsome Self-Absorbed Guys You Happened to Spot in the
  Club:
  .
  Dan - Half man, half existential crisis; subsists on a steady diet of Rimbaud,
  imported cigarettes, and unmarked pills.
  .
  Fixer - The kind of person whose opinions have opinions. Don't get him started
  on data tapes - you'll be there all night.
  .
  Sandman - Mysterious hacker of few words and even fewer discernible emotions.
  Smells vaguely of anti-flea shampoo.
  .
  Shitparade - The leading authority on terrible VR trips, forever on the lookout
  for somebody to inflict them on.
  .
  NoK00l - Stradania's techwear king. Once spent a month's salary on a package of
  "tactical socks," a fact he still brags about.
  .
  Jack - Your friendly neighborhood bartender, always ready with a word of
  encouragement and a novelty cocktail. Oddly unfazed by his club's creepy decor.
  .
  Dates & Wires is the official otome spin-off of weekly webcomic Drugs & Wires,
  featuring the music of NINGEN.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  6 available dates with multiple possible endings and unlockable souvenirs
  .
  2 - 3 hours of playtime, with more than 25,000 words of dialogue
  .
  Hidden scenes, dialogue, and more depending on play order and choices - multiple
  playthroughs recommended!
  .
  Gender-neutral protagonist
  .
  RATING & CONTENT
  .
  Dates & Wires is rated PG-13 for minor language and drug references, mild
  suggestive content, and general cynicism.
  .
  Also contains harsh experimental noise and two minor jump scare-ish moments.
  .
  TIPS FOR FIRST-TIME PLAYERS
  .
  The order in which you choose to tackle the dates will have long-term effects on
  dialogue, scenes, and options - don't be afraid to save and experiment a little
  to see what happens.
  .
  There are seven unlockable souvenirs in the game, six of which are obtained from
  the main characters' best endings. The seventh? You might need to be a little
  cruel for that one...

  My name is Andrew Armstrong from Fermenter. We've just released my debut game,
  David, a physics-based platforming boss-fighter, on Windows and Mac (and iOS
  soon), and we think it's really rad! I'd love it if you give it a play. Have
  fun!
  .
  (Find this info and more at http://www.fermentergames.com/david)
  .
  You play David, an awfully small abstracted chosen hero tossed into a blissfully
  simple world overrun by giant culminations of evil physics-beasts (largely
  inspired by Shadow of the Colossus). As David, you are given a slingshot-esque
  gift that you will have to use to conquer these colossus foes. Hold, aim, and
  fling to attack (Angry Birds style!).
  .
  Think Limbo + Shadow of the Colossus + Angry Birds.
  .
  Features a 9-level campaign, a survival/arena/rpg mode, a secret basket-ball-pit
  minigame, and hats! (Additional levels and other content are in the works.)

description:
  Daydreamour is an extremely short (~15 mins) platformer about a developer
  daydreaming about running. Jump and climb your way through a perilous factory!
  .
  This game was made for the Locally Sourced Spring Bundle in ~5 days using Unity.
  This game is now free that the bundle is over. The small QOL updates are on hold
  until further notice.
  .
  Story:
  .
  Struggling with a creative block, the developer needed something to jump-start
  their drive again. With a sigh, they opened a new tab in their browser and began
  scrolling through videos - something they usually do when they can't make any
  progress.
  .
  While watching a video, they noticed a peculiar parkour video being recommended.
  Curious, they pulled up the video. It was someone running through a factory,
  jumping off walls and avoiding dangerous, forgotten machinery with jumps of
  precision and timing. They were astounded by the prowess of the runner in the
  video.
  .
  Going down a rabbit hole of parkour videos, the developer could feel the
  creativity rushing in. Ideas of parkour filled their head and, like that, they
  got trapped in a state of daydreaming.

  Hit Point Press is now printing physical editions of Dead Friend with a special
  new wraparound cover by Ezra Rose! You can order it on the Hit Point Press
  website. Only the Hit Point Press edition has this cover.
  .
  "Most Innovative" nominee for the 2019 IGDN Indie Groundbreaker Awards!
  .
  Dead Friend is a roleplaying game for a necromancer and a ghost. That is, it's a
  collaborative storytelling game for two players. You will each play the role of
  a friend, one living and one dead. You will ask and answer questions to develop
  the characters, their community, their history together, and the motivations
  leading up to their final conflict. The script follows the dramatic structure of
  a necromancy ritual, and you will use the spellbook of instructions throughout
  the entire game like a witch reading spells from an ancient grimoire. The mood
  may be spooky or intimate, heartwrenching or hilarious - it is up to you as
  storytellers. Dead Friend requires 1 Tarot deck or 1 deck of mundane playing
  cards.

  TESTIMONIALS
  .
  "Two-player RPGs intimidated me at first. I tend toward lighter games for bigger
  groups, and these seemed intense - too intimate, too small. Dead Friend helped
  me understand the appeal: It is intimate, with space to bounce ideas around
  without being overwhelmed, with well-balanced agency between players in
  asymmetrical roles. And, in a year that made it hard for me to keep games on my
  schedule, having Dead Friend on deck as a self-contained, two-to-three-hour
  experience helped resurrect my ability to play at all."

  has enjoyed the free games I have made so far. All proceeds will partly go to
  the lovely @baka-baru and to the development of Mica: Apoptosis. Everyone who
  has donated to Dear Mariko before Crimson's release will get a complimentary
  copy - just shoot me an email at coren.baili@gmail.com. Please do send all bug
  reports to that email as well. Thank you all once again for your support!

  What Happens When We Die?
  .
  Is death really as it seems?
  .
  What if we had the wrong idea?
  .
  What if death wasn't death at all?
  .
  When a visit to the island's mansion turns out to be much more than our
  protagonist bargains for, discover what happens in the aftermath, uncover a
  nefarious secret, and earn an audience with the prestigious lord of the estate.
  .
  Explore The Island
  .
  Explore the island to find curiosities. Experiment to discover their purpose.
  Search the island for a way into the mansion. Talk to people and get to know
  them (or don't, it's up to you.) Who you choose to interact with can change the
  way the game unfolds. There is more than one way to approach this story, and
  more than one tale to be told.
  .
  Discover Curious Creatures
  .
  During your journey you'll encounter a variety of strange and wonderful
  creatures to interact with. Some might be friendly, others might be afraid of
  you, and others still can be dangerous if handled the wrong way. But if you take
  the time to observe them, you might learn a thing or two, and get to know them
  better.
  .
  Characters:
  .
  Darling
  .
  Darling is the main protagonist of the story. After a lengthy preparation
  period, he arrives as a new resident to the island, ready to begin a meaningful
  chapter in his life together with his wife Madeline in their new seaside home.
  But things turn out a bit differently than either of them planned, and a note
  left by Madeline is the start of an unbelievable chain of events...
  .
  Berta
  .
  The proprietress of the local tavern, Berta's meals are popular with residents
  of the island and visitors alike. There's never a slow day at her tavern, and
  she does what she can for those in need. Though, she has been known to take on
  more than she can reasonably handle sometimes.
  .
  Trudy
  .
  Trudy is the headmistress at the only schoolhouse on the island. It is her joy
  teaching children, and she makes the most of every day watching them learn and
  grow. But due to recent occurrences on the island, she and the children have
  lost their access to the school. To make matters worse, now she is being forced
  to tutor the son of the person who caused all this!
  .
  Mindy
  .
  Mindy runs an herbalism practice on the island, as well as a storefront for a
  variety of flora. Effectively she's the island's naturopathic (and only) doctor.
  When dire circumstance begins befalling the residents of the island, Mindy
  discovers she has lost access to her supply of medicines.
  .
  These and many more characters await you in Death? Preposterous!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Play as up to 10 different characters, or as few as 1.
  .
  Befriend key characters and learn more about their lives. Or don't. It's up to
  you.

  Interact with creatures in refreshingly non-violent, puzzle-like encounters.

  way you played through it.

  gameplay experience.

  .
  "As debut efforts go, Dj Vu is a great go of it. The puzzle designs are unique
  and well thought out, and the cloning mechanic adds a great twist to the rule-
  set that requires forward thinking in ways other titles in the genre haven't
  needed before."
  .
  Xbox Tavern
  .
  "Finally, Danielle and Eric decided that the pice de rsistance was cloning.....
  Oh developers, you know how to make a man work for his game completion. This
  last element was a masterstroke, and it made me think outside of the box. You
  must think several moves ahead, inputting the path you wish your clones to take.
  Once you are ready, you set them on their way, all while you try to progress
  through the stage."
  .
  Bonus Stage
  .
  "It's these tricks which Dj Vu keeps hidden until the right time, which puts an
  unexpected twist on the puzzling action to keep things fresh and interesting. It
  feels original, innovative and is well-paced"

  enemies, wyrd magics, and ancient monstrosities. It has a simple turn-based
  combat system, rules for building your hold and optional challenges for a harder
  experience.
  .
  Inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, DELVE aims to capture
  that feeling of building and protecting a fortress in an unforgiving
  subterranean world.
  .
  All you need to play is, a pencil, paper (preferably 1" grid), and a deck of
  playing cards.
  .
  The Under-King has put out a bounty to all the holds demanding a Void Crystal, a
  rare and powerful gem found only in the deepest caverns.
  .
  Each round your dwarves will mine another square of the grid, you draw a card
  from your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts  and Diamonds
  are resources and trade goods that you'll use for building and hiring units
  while Clubs  and Spades  are natural formations and forgotten ruins. From
  ancient libraries to goblin lairs, these subterranean locales will become part
  of your hold's unique layout and may provide unexpected benefits. Or you might
  just unleash a horde of ravenous insects in which case, you'll need to fight.
  .
  Combat in DELVE is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking
  without weighing you down with book-keeping. Enemies follow a tower-defense
  style path towards your hold's entrance while you move your units in simple
  turn-based tactical combat. Utilise traps, ranged attacks, and special units to
  face deadly foes or record your hold's epic demise.
  .
  DELVE will also be supported with ongoing updates and expansions which bring new
  features such as farming, trading, the Cave Sea, and more. Or you can check out
  RISE (a dungeon building variant which tasks you with keeping your mutinious
  minions happy) or UMBRA (a sci-fi variant with challenges you with colonising
  strange alien planets).

game: Delve Too Deep (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/D/Delve Too Deep (USA)/Delve Too Deep (USA).json
developer: seedling
publisher: seedling
genre: Role Playing
description:
  The old empire of Tuje committed many foolish acts in their search for power,
  and one of them was to dig so deep they tore a hole in reality. Now, a thousand
  years later, a strange elevator-like device has been discovered above an
  apparently bottomless borehole. One expedition went down, and the elevator
  returned, empty. Now it is up to you to find out what happened, rescue any
  survivors, and uncover the secrets of this strange site.
  .
  What sort of system to use?
  .
  New: 13th Age Roleplaying Game compatibility guide also included!
  .
  You don't need much other than some kind of mechanism for resolving outcomes
  based on players' abilities. It was playtested using a very minimal system we
  made up on the spot. The decisions the players make are most important.
  .
  It's assumed magic exists, technology is limited, and little is known of what
  happens if you dig too deep underground. It could work for many popular and
  unpopular fantasy adventure systems, so long as your table likes character-
  driven stories, and could probably work with many modern or sci fi games, with
  some adaptation.
  .
  There is the opportunity to add combat, but if it combat occurs, you will need
  to select appropriate monsters for your game system. It is not a major focus of
  the adventure.
  .
  This game lasts about one session, but could be added to a larger dungeon
  complex or other area to explore.

description:
  Desert Mothers is a multiplayer virtual reality meditation circle. Players begin
  in the same procedurally-generated environment.  This diverges for each as their
  personal environment, composed of individualized weather and hallucinations,
  responds emotionally to the player's actions.
  .
  The constraints within which the players interact are discovered during play,
  and revolve around the body, simulated breath, drawing in the air, and out-of-
  body exploration of flora, fauna, and abandoned human habitations.
  .
  "El ambiente que se logra nos pone a prueba, nos exige que reelaboremos
  continuamente nuestra relación con el espacio y el tiempo, nos sugieren que la
  meditación y la introspección establece una nueva relación con el afuera y
  pueden efectivamente cambiarlo." - Guido Saá, Game On exhibition catalog
  .
  ("The environment that is achieved puts us to the test, it requires us to rework
  continuously our relationship with space and time, they suggest that meditation
  and introspection establishes a new relationship with the outside and can
  effectively change it.")
  .
  Virtual reality version requires Windows with Oculus Rift and Touch controllers,
  or Quest. It has not been tested on Quest 2 so I'd appreciate feedback!

developer: Tea-Powered Games
publisher: Tea-Powered Games
genre: Visual Novel;Interactive Fiction
description:
  Dialogue: A Writer's Story is a PC/Mac game about conversations, writing and
  science. In Dialogue, you play out a year in the life of Lucille, a writer
  working on her science fantasy novel, whose content is highly inspired by her
  neighbour Adrian's research subject, biochemistry.
  .
  The game consists of various types of conversations with different mechanics.
  Active conversations occur in real-time, and the effect of Lucille's statements
  can be modified through her equipped Focus. Exploratory conversations map
  different subjects spatially, allowing for backtracking and finding new paths,
  while emails can be arranged and edited.
  .
  Dialogue combines ease and depth of play to provide a well-rounded narrative
  experience grounded in everyday life. The game is fully voice acted, with a
  relaxing soundtrack and European cartoon-inspired characters. A playthrough of
  Dialogue takes around 3-6 hours.
  .
  The story in Dialogue is grounded in real life challenges and tensions, telling
  the story of relatable but interesting characters. We have drawn from our
  personal experiences to talk about the difficulties involved in two major areas.
  .
  The first is the creative process, both in Lucille's writing of her novel, and
  other people's reactions to it. The player will have insight into Lucille's
  struggles and triumphs as she changes characters, creates twists in the story
  and struggles to find a satisfying conclusion.
  .
  The second is how real scientific research is carried out, how it is seen by
  people outside of the research community. Adrian's year is focused on working
  with his unruly cells, and the player will get to experience the worries and
  joys of being a researcher.
  .
  Hey Poor Player - "True to its name, it boasts the most comprehensive dialogue
  system I've ever seen in a game... In Dialogue, understanding and empathizing
  with people is very much an end in itself. ...I found myself wanting to be more
  like Lucille - someone genuinely interested in people and their complex
  personalities."
  .
  VideoGamer - "There's a nice mingling of science and creativity, and it realises
  the process of sieving information to get to the nuggets of interesting and
  imaginative things remarkably well."
  .
  Fuwa Novel - "Dialogue: A Writer's Story is probably the best depiction of what
  it's like to be a writer you'll ever find in games."
  .
  Dialogue is the inaugural game of Tea-Powered Games. As a company, we focus on
  expanding the narrative vocabulary of digital games, both in terms of stories
  and mechanics, with a holistic design approach. Tea-Powered Games was founded by
  a writer (Flo) and designer (Des) who had been making games and writing stories
  during their research jobs.
  .

  Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is an anti-adventure game about picking up trash
  in an alien bazaar. Play as the Janitor, an Alaensee girlbeast with a
  municipally-subsidized trash incineration job and dreams of leaving the planet
  of Xabran's Rock far behind her.
  .
  Explore the Spaceport! Navigate the maze of alleyways, side streets, plazas, and
  bridges as you search for discarded items to burn. Investigate one of various
  entrances to the mysterious subterranean sewerdungeon, or climb the ominously
  symmetrical Ziggurat to get a better view of the urban landscape! If you pay
  attention and keep track of landmarks, you won't get lost... probably.
  .
  Embrace routine! Spend your days cleaning up litter, finding food, and testing
  your luck at lottoshrines scattered throughout the area. Daily tasks form the
  backbone of your life as the Janitor, providing structure and monotonous
  security in an uncertain world! Do not deviate from your routine. Pray, work,
  eat, sleep. Do not deviate from your routine.
  .
  Suffer the Curse! Stick your scentflaps where you shouldn't, and you may just
  walk away with an ancient cranial entity haunting your every waking moment!
  Consult local Necresses, pray to the Nine Goddesses, purchase ritual objects,
  and rub the giant sword to balance your personal luck favorably! Maybe that will
  make the whispering stop!
  .
  Embark on an anti-adventure! Find a middle ground between your life of menial
  drudgery and a culture of exciting quests and powerful heroes, and you might
  finally find a way off Xabran's Rock!

  Dinos for Quest Volume I is a mini booklet of dinosaur NPCs designed for the
  Quest TTRPG system.
  .
  This booklet includes four NPCs:
  .
  Neovenator - A solitary ambush predator and sometimes scavenger.
  .
  Diplodocus - A massive herbivore that can cause tremendous damage (without
  meaning to).
  .
  Centrosaurus - An ornery plant-eater known to charge down anyone who gets too
  close.
  .
  Microraptor - A small flying pack hunter with beautiful plumage.
  .
  Each NPC includes a large full colour illustration and a size comparison chart.
  .
  Each of these NPCs come with a full compliment of stats so they are usable in
  your games of Quest. Each of them also includes details and colour to better
  enable storytelling involving these fantastic creatures.
  .
  Additionally, this booklet includes an adventure scenario that can be used to
  highlight each of these new PCs.
  .
  Dinos for Quest is an ongoing project that seeks to add dozens of prehistoric
  creatures to the catalogue of NPCs available for use in Quest.
  .
  These NPCs were designed using the resources created by J.N. Butler in their
  excellent Monster Manifest. That product is available here:

  Discsphere
  .
  About the game, the ramble-y, not so formal version:
  .
  ( Feel free to skip to the short version if you're short on time or already know
  what the game is about.)
  .
  Discsphere is an easy-to-learn sports game where your objective is to throw a
  sphere at your opponent. The catch? You have to capture 3 goals with discs
  before you can throw spheres. You can also throw power discs on a cooldown timer
  to stun your opponent, or to remove ownership of an opponent's goal.
  .
  Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the dodge rolls, activated by tapping
  a movement key in multiplayer and by pressing the dedicated dodge roll key in
  single-player.
  .
  Did I mention the game has a single-player mode? It has a single-player mode.
  The single-player mode has a story and boss battles, and even has two final
  bosses depending on how you go about defeating the bosses.
  .
  Oh yeah, when you first play the game, please play the tutorial first! The game
  does not play very conventionally, so you'll need to understand how everything
  works before you begin! Even if you remap the controls, that won't really
  explain everything there is to know.
  .
  About the game, the short, somewhat more formal version:
  .
  ( Feel free to skip right to downloading the game if you already know what the
  game is about.)
  .
  Discsphere is a sports game about capturing goals which also has elements of
  dodgeball. The game has a conventional multiplayer mode and a boss-battle-
  focused unconventional single-player mode, which both have slightly different
  controls. Playing the tutorial before playing the game for your first time is
  recommended. Just remapping the controls isn't enough to understand how
  everything works here.
  .
  The obligatory features list:
  .
  Single-player and multiplayer modes!
  .
  Keyboard controls with support for remapping!*
  .
  A dedicated dodge roll button, only in the single-player mode!**
  .
  Two ways to win: Hit your opponent with a sphere, or have more goals than your
  opponent when times runs out!
  .
  Multiple stage layout options in multiplayer, including the option to randomly
  cycle between stages after every point scored!
  .
  Several songs, randomly cycled in the multiplayer mode and carefully picked to
  be relevant in the single-player mode!***
  .
  You play as a knight in the single-player mode!! I mean, why not!!!
  .
  Boss battles!
  .
  A sort of overworld segment thing for the single-player mode between the boss
  battles! This gives you a breather between bosses.
  .
  Two final bosses, the arguably harder one requiring you to win by time against
  every boss in the game!
  .
  A generally speaking highly experimental design!
  .
  You can turn off music with Control+M! (You can't un-mute it immediately but
  Shift+M will make music play once more the next time the game changes scenes.)
  .
  *There are programs out there if you need to play this with a controller. Sorry,
  good controller support is really hard to code and even harder to code for more
  than one player with the engine I'm using in mind. ;_;
  .
  Game development can be hard,,,
  .
  **I didn't think to add this until part-way through the game's development and
  with how the keyboard remapping works, it would've been difficult to add this
  .
  ***Some of the songs only play in the single-player mode.
  .
  A note from the developer:
  .
  Hey guys, this is a note from Adam. Not going to be joking around quite as much
  as I did with most of the rest of this page. Maybe I'll throw in a joke or two
  for those of you who otherwise might not read something like this.
  .
  First of all, thanks for considering playing my game. It does mean something to
  me. ^_^
  .
  Second off, I made this game because another project of mine was... well, it was
  going well, technically speaking. But I needed a break. I burned myself out on
  it. So to take my mind off of all of that, I kind of just sat back somewhat
  unproductively. But then an idea for a sports video game popped into my head.
  .
  Which is strange, sports video games aren't usually exactly a genre I see myself
  playing much. But the idea sounded like fun, and sounded simple enough to make,
  so I set out to make it. And here we are now.
  .
  Honestly, most of the time went into making the single-player mode. Most of the
  multiplayer content was done less than a week after the game's development
  started, and the last-minute addition of alternate stage layouts only took maybe
  15 minutes of work.
  .
  Despite that, I really hope you can give both the single-player and the
  multiplayer a fair shake. The game was designed for multiplayer first and
  foremost, with the single-player coming later. If you don't have somebody to
  play with locally, there's programs out there for playing local multiplayer
  games in online multiplayer.
  .
  If you need help finding such a program, well, might I recommend Parsec?
  http://parsecgaming.com
  .
  Anyways, because this game is so experimental in its design, I didn't wanna
  charge people up-front for the game. I don't know who this game is for, if
  anybody, and I don't feel like anybody will know for sure until they've already
  played it. To that end, you can download the game for free. I recommend you do
  so at first. I don't want you to feel ripped off.
  .
  However, if you like the game, a donation would be appreciated. $1 if you feel
  like you got some fun out of it, and $5 if you feel like you really liked it,
  sounds like a fair value to me, but feel free to go higher or lower as you wish.
  Just... please don't over-do it, only put in the money if you can actually
  afford it!
  .
  Whatever the case may be, regardless of whether you put in money or not, I hope
  you enjoy the game! ^v^
  .
  ~Adam
  .
  Extra stuff for paying more:
  .
  If you put in $5, you get an added bonus in the form of high and low quality
  soundtrack downloads! The MP3 version sounds incredibly wrong though, it's
  mostly included as a joke, I recommend using the OGG soundtrack for most
  purposes and the FLAC soundtrack if you don't mind downloading a larger file
  like that. There's also a file included that includes every version of the
  soundtrack, just in case you were hoping to download them all anyways.
  .
  There aren't any incentives for paying any more than that (at least, not yet),
  but as I said earlier, feel free to pay more if you want to!
  .
  One last thing of note:
  .
  We also have a press kit available for the game. Currently, you can download it

  this is a game where you play as queer witches who work in a restaurant, using
  brute force, magic, and the power of gay to handle whatever your GM (General
  Manager) throws at you.
  .
  i wanted to experiment with making a game that is explicitly designed for the GM
  to be antagonistic toward the player characters, in a way that mirrors real life
  power imbalances most of us have had to deal with.
  .
  please be sure to discuss safety tools before running the game. this may become
  especially important in a game explicitly designed to have a hostile GM role.
  see the TTRPG Safety Toolkit by Kienna Shaw & Lauren Bryant-Monk for a thorough
  survey of commonly used safety tools and consent mechanics.
  .
  this game works best with 3-4 players and a GM. each player will need 2d6, a
  blank sheet of paper, and a pencil. it is designed in such a way that sessions
  can be very short or very long, depending on the amount of detail the GM decides
  to include.

description:
  Our world is but one among many. We exist in a single paper-sharp slice of
  reality, pressed between the past and future, adjacent to the imaginary and
  unimaginable, above death and beneath eternity. Each layer of reality exists in
  relation to all the rest, and the paths we chart between them are often tangled
  to the point of absurdity. These worlds, the relationships between them, and the
  paths that wind between, are collectively known as the Disparateum.
  .
  As we speak, someone in the Disparateum is wandering the halls of a fractal
  museum-dungeon. Someone is planning a heist to steal a story from a mechanical
  dragon. Someone is running through a mirrored world while their reflection
  silently hunts them. Someone is flying through the streets of a collective dream
  to catch a bauble that'll grant them their heart's desire. Someone is opening a
  locked and dusty door in their soul to find something they tried to forget.
  .
  It could be you. The Disparateum waits for you to take the stage.
  .

  .
  This game is in development! It currently contains Act I of Disparateum, as well
  as small business, the first of an eventual seven adventure modules included in
  the zine Seven Plays from the Disparateum. The current plan is for two more
  Acts, six more adventures, and a number of other supplementary materials, all
  contributed to by fantastic writers, game designers, and authors in the indie
  space. All the money this game makes will be going directly towards the goal of
  putting together that team of contributors and making really cool things with
  them, and while I've got a pretty good sense of what the other two Acts of the
  main book are gonna contain, the adventures and supplemental materials are gonna
  be free range and really, really weird. Can't wait for you to join us on this
  journey!

  In this sequel to 2013's breakout musical hit, Dominique Pamplemousse in "It's
  All Over Once The Fat Lady Sings!", our favourite genderqueer private detective
  discovers that, through the power of multiple endings from the previous game,
  they have been cloned! Join the two Dominiques as they traverse surreal
  locations and interrogate increasingly bizarre characters in order to answer a
  very important question: which one of them is canon?

  There is also plenty of singing. And feelings. And, of course, singing about

  investigator of ambiguous gender only one rent payment away from homelessness.
  When the CEO of a major record company shows up asking Dominique to locate a
  missing pop star, taking the job appears to be the straightforward thing to do.
  However, as things are never quite as they seem in these kinds of stories,
  Dominique winds up framed for a crime they didn't commit, bringing to surface
  their mysterious past and the events that led them to take up shady detective
  work in the first place.

  Oh, and did I mention it's a musical? With singing and everything?

  a game about looking at a tree and thinking about norms of the society

  .
  two seeds for a solo game where you write a letter
  .
  First, take one six-sided dice (1D6) and choose don't cut the tree or be the
  tree.
  .
  Then, read this game before going out or doing activities (maybe the morning
  before work, or before taking the train/bus to see a friend, or just before you
  go for a walk). Do your stuff, activity or work without forgetting this game
  because you'll play when you get home.
  .
  At home, you'll need a pen and a sheet of paper. If you want to play the both
  seeds, please allow time to pass between each part : the best is to wait 1 day,
  but you can also just doing something else during one hour before playing the
  second seed.

  WHERE DOES THE IDEA CAME FROM
  .
  This game is my submission for the Pride Month gamejam. First, I wanted to make
  a game only about asexuality, then opened to every orientation , then the idea
  has grown again to finish into this two-letters-game(s). I recommend queer
  people to play "don't cut the tree" and straight people to play "be the tree",
  but please play as you like (or read the all document: only 2 pages ;) ). You
  can also play one of the game, and give the letter to someone else with the
  second game, so this person could answer to your letter.
  .
  If you play the game and write a letter, I should be happy to have your opinion
  on this game and your feelings during it. As the letter could become really
  personal, I would understand if you keep it for you. Just share your feelings
  about the game
  .
  INSPIRATIONS
  .
  Quill (Scott Malthouse), A wish for something better (Sorry not sorry games),
  Spoons (The Falling Dream), Brave Sparrow (Avery Alder), and I guess a lot of
  other games I read but never play; as a lot of random generator I saw but never
  used.

developer: Armor Games Studios
publisher: Armor Games Studios
genre: Adventure
description:
  Following a bizarre cataclysmic event that cracked the moon in half, the Earth
  is struggling with the environmental fallout. Everything is already dead or
  dying... except you. Or so you think. Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is a post-
  apocalyptic thriller from veteran developer Scriptwelder, creator of the popular
  horror series Deep Sleep and Don't Escape. Players must figure out a way to
  properly fortify their home against each night's new danger, as they learn the
  truth behind the apocalypse and search for a way to safety, if one exists.
  .
  Players will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end of the
  world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each chapter
  of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog
  or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result,
  you'll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But you don't
  have forever. Certain actions advance the in-game clock, and you'll need to
  complete your preparations to (hopefully) stay alive before night falls.
  .
  Will you make it through all four days? Will your companions?
  .
  Features:
  .
  A classic pixelart aesthetic and creepy atmosphere from a veteran of horror and
  thrillers.
  .
  Logical puzzles and exploration to challenge players without frustrating them.
  .
  Time mechanics; certain actions advance the clock in a race against time.
  .
  A post-apocalyptic thriller, with an engaging storyline and cast.
  .
  Moody and engrossing original musicial score.
  .
  Multiple variations for each chapter mean multiple playthroughs with new
  content.
  .
  About the Developer:
  .
  Poland-based developer Scriptwelder is a well known creator of creepy web-based
  games, perhaps the most iconic of which is the Deep Sleep series, which has won
  multiple awards and been played by millions all around the world. The Don't
  Escape series began as a web game that inverted the classic escape-the-room
  formula... rather than trying to find a way out, players were instead trying to
  find a way to secure themselves within, usually from some sort of threat or
  danger. Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is his first full length premium game.

  "Look, just try not to take it too hard..."
  .
  You're a college freshman with college freshman problems: you've got an awful
  professor, your roommate's kind of a flake, and this week really just hasn't
  been going your way.  Luckily, you've got just the thing planned for this
  weekend: a night in the woods with the girl you've been (sorta?) seeing and your
  new (sorta?) friends.  But things are never that easy.  As you receive strange
  phone calls and hear concerning noises from beyond the treeline, tensions arise
  in your small camp, and choices must be made that will determine your fate...
  or, at least, the fate of your relationships with your friends.
  .
  Don't Take it Personally, I Just Don't Like You is a lo-fi relationship dramedy
  about camping illegally on government property in the chill of early autumn,
  having public anxiety attacks in crowded shopping malls, the people we choose to
  be with, and what we do when they don't choose us back.  In this demo, you'll be
  introduced to several characters and locations from the full game (including two
  romanceable characters!) in a fully self-contained, hour-long story.
  .
  Demo Features:
  .
  Play as a guy, gal, or non-binary pal.
  .
  Go on a camping trip with two of your friends (I heard one of them likes you!)
  .
  Four different endings.
  .
  Listen to some chill beats by Lofi Dreams.
  .
  Share your deepest fears.
  .
  Drink in the woods and plan the fall of capitalism.

  ABOUT
  .
  This is the original Prototype game idea for Dorfromantik created in April 2020
  for Ludum Dare 46. This free prototype got submitted and accepted for the
  "Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality" as a free game.
  .
  Dorfromantik is a peaceful building strategy and puzzle game where you create a
  beautiful and ever-growing village landscape by placing tiles.
  .
  After getting lots of positive feedback we decided to start working on a full
  game based on this game idea. The full game DORFROMANTIK was released on Steam
  and GOG on March 25th 2021 by our newly formed studio Toukana - you can download
  our Presskit HERE. If you like the Dorfromantik Prototype and would like to stay

  Physical Copies Sold Out! Check out .dungeon//remastered to see progress as I
  work towards a new printing!
  .
  .dungeon is a book about traveling through a virtual, fantasy world. One person
  takes on the role of the World, filling in the nooks and crannies with dungeons
  and adventures that they think up or borrow from books they already own.
  Everyone else is a Player and creates a Character to explore those nooks,
  discover their treasure, and interact with NPCs and other flesh-and-blood folks
  in the virtual world.
  .
  The thing that sets .dungeon apart from other books is the inspiration it takes
  from social games like Werewolf and Munchkin. The real world can (and will)
  affect the game you create. Each class has different powers based on physical
  things you do, or different parts of your life. The witch uses their tattoos to
  cast spells while the wizard uses their favorite book. The knight makes vows
  while the leader can offer gifts to the other players to aid them. There are 10
  classes total to choose from, including the bard, the troll, and the artist.
  .
  Beyond that, the game functions on a simple contest system.
  .
  You assign dice (like the d4, and the d8) to your stats
  .
  Roll the appropriate die when facing an obstacle
  .
  If you roll higher than the obstacle, you succeed!
  .
  If you roll lower, you take damage equal to the difference
  .
  Also included in the book:
  .
  A simple oracle system
  .
  NPC charts for plotting in-depth characters
  .
  A quest generator
  .
  Advice/tools for porting adventures/monsters over to .dungeon with ease
  .
  One of the winners of The Awards

  Here's a long playlist of original music made just for .dungeon and free to use
  in your podcasts, actual plays, or youtube videos.

  other players. Are they wrong? Are you wrong? You can now see stats on decisions
  you make in-game. We want to know which ones players agreed on and which ones
  generated differences in opinion.
  .
  We also added more problems for you to address! 20 new dilemmas which will get
  you thinking what should I do? More moral problems! We've added more scenarios
  where you have to make tough choices about what's right and what's wrong, so
  that we can keep expanding on this aspect of gameplay and give you more
  difficult decisions to make.
  .
  We also care about privacy, so we had to build our own custom system to track
  all the trolley problems.
  .
  We're committed to making sure that our trolley problem game is as safe and
  secure as possible-we don't track or store any personal information about our
  users. Only you see your decisions and how you compare to others. When you make
  a decision it's recorded anonymously without any data attached to you.
  .
  The 2020 Retrospective Update
  .
  The game includes the 2020 Retrospective update!
  .
  The Base Game
  .
  Dr. Trolley's Problem brings the classic philosophical quandaries of The Trolley
  Problem to life and asks you to make life or death decisions on the fly. Explore
  your moral fiber in ways you never imagined (or asked for)!
  .
  Dr. Trolley is an infamous robot mad scientist from another dimension which has
  sequestered you in its simulation to answer the most pressing questions:
  .
  Should humans be allowed to drive cars? Or would driving (and most other things)
  be safer in the hands of Artificial Intelligence?
  .
  Along the way Dr. Trolley will probe all the classic philosophical quandaries of
  The Trolley Problem. You'll be asked life or death decisions on the fly. You'll
  explore your moral fibre in ways you never imagined (or asked for). You'll find
  out what your friends are made of. And you'll help Dr. Trolley decide if you're
  capable of making any decisions at all!
  .
  Prepare earn your PhD in Trolleyology!
  .
  This game is game made for the love of The Trolley Problem and all the weird and
  wonderful questions it makes you ask about yourself. We thought it would be fun
  to develop a platform for extending the Trolley Problem in all directions. We
  eventually want to collect accurate statistics about the choices people make
  (de-identified data, of course) so users can see what choices other people made
  in the strange situations the game presents. We'd also like to add new
  situations over time, possibly themed in interesting ways.
  .
  Currently the game includes 50 ethical situations that last anywhere from 30
  seconds to one minute each. Some situations involve reading what is presented on
  screen. Within each situation the player decides whether or not to act to save a
  character (or not).
  .
  Consider your philosophy.

game: Dragon And Warrior (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/D/Dragon And Warrior (USA)/Dragon And Warrior (USA).json
developer: OrionCanning
publisher: OrionCanning
genre: Action;Role Playing
description:
  You can now order physical copies from Drive Thru RPG!
  .
  The Warrior stands before the king who tells them that they are the next in a
  long line of warriors of legend tasked with fighting off an evil tyrant. That is
  how every game begins, but from then on the players shape the setting, scenery,
  and the story itself through gameplay.
  .
  Four roles craft the narrative: the Warrior, the Villain, the Ally, and
  Treasure. The Warrior controls the actions of the story's protagonist. The
  Villain invents conflicts, monsters, and characters who stand in the Warrior's
  way. The Ally steers the townsfolk, shopkeepers, and the Warrior's friends-all
  whom aid the Warrior's journey and send them on quests. Lastly, Treasure
  describes the world itself, breathing life into setting and scenery, as well as
  whatever items the Warrior finds on their journey.
  .
  Players are encouraged to ask provocative questions about the parts of the story
  the other players' roles control, allowing everyone to push the story towards
  what piques their curiosity. Players frequently switch roles during the game,
  giving everyone a chance to say what the Warrior does next. Questions serve a
  double purpose of useful prompts to jumpstart one another's imaginations.
  .
  Drawing is a meaningful part of the gameplay as well. Depending on their role,
  players might draw maps of towns and dungeons they explore, or sketch the
  monsters and challenges that lie in wait for the Warrior. When the players
  switch roles, so do the drawings they were working on, allowing other players to
  fill in details, or introduce characters and settings based on someone else's
  art.
  .
  There are just enough stats and strategy to give Dragon and Warrior the feel of
  a turn-based RPG video game battle without having so many rules that they hinder
  player creativity. Conflict is quick and exciting-a back and forth card game of
  attacking, blocking, and maneuvering for the right opening. Characters can be
  built to focus on powerful strikes, quick agility, or magic spells, and they
  will slowly grow in power throughout the campaign-as will their enemies.
  .
  Dragon and Warrior is based on old school JRPG video games, combining strategic
  turn-based battles with the play-to-find-out style of indie RPGs. It is a stand
  alone game that can be played as a campaign or a one shot, for 2-6+ players.

game: Dragon's Grave - Driven by Bids (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/D/Dragon's Grave - Driven by Bids (USA)/Dragon's Grave - Driven by Bids (USA).json
developer: Tim Bannock
publisher: Tim Bannock
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Dragon's Grave is dark fantasy on an epic scale: two iconic dragons fought until
  they perished, and from their bones and viscera, living dungeons have formed.
  These terrifying catacombs can swallow entire cities, and spawn monsters that
  constantly mutate, threatening everyone!
  .
  The gods walk the land as juggernauts formed by the dragons' death, and the many
  folk of the world are also descended from them in a similar way. The player
  characters will be epically powerful. They are driven by two tropes that combine
  ancestry, class, background, magical power, and other wide-ranging traits. There
  abilities are the purview of high-level characters in standard fantasy
  roleplaying games: they are immensely powerful, facing off against the minions
  of gods, or the gods themselves! Or worse yet, dangers spawned from the corpses
  of dragons.
  .
  Features two PDFs in a widescreen landscape layout and a 6x9-style one-column
  layout, allowing you to optimize for your screen of choice. Both PDFs are fully
  bookmarked and linked.

  Hello World is one file, three lines.
  .
  This is all you need to create a game. One file. One method called tick. Here we
  render the current step value as a label:
  .
  def tick args
  .
  args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, args.state.tick_count]
  .
  end
  .
  That's it. If you know how to use the array datatype in any language, you know
  everything needed to get started with DragonRuby Game Toolkit. Play around with
  the engine in your browser.
  .
  You can skim our documentation here if you need more details.
  .
  Output: Six rendering primitives are all you need.
  .
  Here are the six draw primitives you need to know: solids, sprites, labels,
  lines, borders, and sounds. Here is how you use them:
  .
  def tick args
  .
  # draw a blue square that's half way faded out
  .
  args.outputs.solids << [100, 100, 50, 50, 0, 0, 255, 128]
  .
  # draw a red label
  .
  args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, "This is a label.", 255, 0, 0]
  .
  # draw a sprite turned 45 degrees and half way faded out
  .
  args.outputs.sprites << [200, 200, 50, 50, 'ninja.png', 45, 128]
  .
  # draw a diagonal green line from bottom left to top right
  .
  args.outputs.lines << [0, 0, 1280, 720, 0, 255, 0]
  .
  # draw a black border (unfilled square)
  .
  args.outputs.borders << [100, 100, 50, 50, 0, 0, 0, 255]
  .
  # play a sound every second
  .
  args.outputs.sounds << "ping.wav" if args.state.tick_count % 60 == 0
  .
  end
  .
  That's it. You now know the entire render API for DragonRuby.
  .
  Here's a more complicated example. This is how you create a nighttime scene,
  with a title, and a ninja:
  .
  solids: A black background, and two hundred stars made of tiny squares.
  .
  labels: Display some smokey-white text.
  .
  sounds: Play a sound when the game starts up.
  .
  sprites: Render a sprite on the screen.
  .
  lines: Draw a line representing the floor
  .
  borders: Frame the entire scene with a white border.
  .
  def tick args
  .
  # destructure args into local variables
  .
  state, outputs, grid = args.state, args.outputs, args.grid
  .
  # set some default values for the game
  .
  state.colors.background ||= [0, 0, 0]
  .
  state.colors.star       ||= [128, 200, 255]
  .
  state.colors.text       ||= [200, 200, 200]
  .
  state.colors.landmarks  ||= [255, 255, 255]
  .
  state.night             ||= [grid.rect, state.colors.background]
  .
  state.stars             ||= 200.map do
  .
  [rand * grid.w,
  .
  rand * grid.h,
  .
  rand * 2 + 2,
  .
  rand * 2 + 2,
  .
  state.colors.star]
  .
  end
  .
  # start up some background music
  .
  outputs.sounds  << "opening_fx.wav" if state.tick_count == 0
  .
  # render the background and stars
  .
  outputs.solids  << state.night
  .
  outputs.solids  << state.stars
  .
  # set a title for the game
  .
  outputs.labels  << [grid.left + 50, grid.top  - 50,
  .
  "Ninja Game", state.colors.text]
  .
  # set a sprite
  .
  outputs.sprites << [50, 50, 50, 50, 'ninja.png']
  .
  # create a line that represents the ground
  .
  outputs.lines   << [grid.left,
  .
  grid.bottom + 50,
  .
  grid.right,
  .
  grid.bottom + 50,
  .
  state.colors.landmarks]
  .
  # create a border to frame the game
  .
  outputs.borders << [grid.left + 1,
  .
  grid.bottom + 1,
  .
  grid.right - 1,
  .
  grid.top - 1,
  .
  state.colors.landmarks]
  .
  end
  .
  Input: Controllers, Mouse, and Keyboard.
  .
  This is how you move a sprite using your gamepad:
  .
  args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
  .
  args.outputs.sprites << [args.state.ninja.x, 300,
  .
  50, 50,
  .
  'ninja.png']
  .
  if args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.right
  .
  args.state.ninja.x += 10
  .
  elsif args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.left
  .
  args.state.ninja.x -= 10
  .
  end
  .
  This is how you move a sprite using your mouse:
  .
  args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
  .
  args.outputs.sprites << [
  .
  args.state.ninja.x,
  .
  300,
  .
  50,
  .
  50,
  .
  'ninja.png'
  .
  ]
  .
  if args.inputs.mouse.click
  .
  args.state.ninja.x = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.x
  .
  end
  .
  This is how you move a sprite using your keyboard:
  .
  args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
  .
  args.outputs.sprites << [
  .
  args.state.ninja.x, 300, 50, 50,
  .
  'ninja.png'
  .
  ]
  .
  if args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.right
  .
  args.state.ninja.x += 10
  .
  elsif args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.left
  .
  args.state.ninja.x -= 10
  .
  end
  .
  Game State: Entities and Collision.
  .
  Randomly create 500 ninjas on the screen. Create a lookup table that contains
  the alpha property of ninjas that have collided. Present all ninjas with their
  alpha properties set.
  .
  def tick args
  .
  # destructure args into local variables
  .
  grid, state, outputs = args.grid, args.state, args.outputs
  .
  # use Game Toolkit's built in helper methods to create
  .
  # adhoc entities
  .
  state.ninjas ||= 500.map do
  .
  state.new_entity(:ninja,
  .
  rect: [grid.w.-(50) * rand,
  .
  grid.h.-(50) * rand,
  .
  50,
  .
  50])
  .
  end
  .
  # use Ruby's powerful apis to determine collision
  .
  state.collisions ||= state.ninja
  .
  .product
  .
  .reject { |n, n2| n == n2 }
  .
  .find_all { |n, n2| n.rect.intersects_rect?(n2.rect) }
  .
  .map { |n, _| [n.entity_id, 128] }
  .
  .pairs_to_hash
  .
  #render everything to the screen
  .
  outputs.sprites << state.ninjas.map do |n|
  .
  [n.rect, 'dragonruby.png', 0,
  .
  state.collisions[n.entity_id] || 255]
  .
  end
  .
  end
  .
  The developers behind DragonRuby Game Toolkit.
  .
  This is Ryan C. Gordon (Wikipedia), he is one of the juggernauts behind Simple
  DirectMedia Layer (Wikipedia).
  .
  Ya know...
  .
  SDL.
  .
  That low-level library that powers thousands of games, Triple-A game engines,
  and Valve's Steam client?
  .
  He's also worked on porting a number of games to Linux and Mac OS: such as
  Braid, Super Meat Boy, Dear Esther, and LIMBO.
  .
  And this is Amir Rajan, he is an indie game dev with titles on iOS, Android,
  desktop, and Nintendo Switch... amassing 3 million downloads and counting
  (Nintendo, Kill Screen, The New Yorker). And yes, all these games are built with
  the DragonRuby Runtime.
  .
  Both of these guys hate the complexity of today's engines. And as luck would
  have it, their paths ended up crossing. After six months and 50,000 lines of
  DragonRuby Runtime enhancements, Ryan and Amir now have a live/hot loadable,
  cruft-free, productive game engine that can target... well... any gaming device
  you can think of.

developer: FractalDragon
publisher: FractalDragon
genre: Role Playing
description:
  You get to be a dragon
  .
  You get to kiss dragons
  .
  Need I say more?  This Tabletop RPG is about about the clash of over-sized
  personalities between shapeshifters who can assume human or dragon form, or
  anything in between. It's a GMless-meaning everyone has equal narrative
  authority-and plays best over one or two 3-4 hour sessions, with 3-4 players.
  .
  What about the Dragons, though?
  .
  What is the fantasy of being a dragon? To me, dragons are interesting because
  they embody so many seemingly contradictory elements: they are powerful but
  vulnerable, unyielding but capricious, even tireless-but-sleepy. The one thing
  they aren't, in this game, is reserved: Dragons' emotions are all turned up to
  11, and they aren't afraid to let everyone know exactly how they feel.
  .
  What about the Hearts, though?
  .
  Notably though, while romance between characters is facilitated by the game and
  made as safe as possible by included support mechanics, it's also entirely opt-
  in: you declare on character creation whether your dragon is Open To Romance,
  and can change your mind at any time.
  .
  And how does this game actually play?
  .
  Dragonhearts is made of several small scene types you play for different
  situations, like if you want to have big cool dragon duels At Each Other's
  Throats-which may at any moment become liaisons In Each Other's Arms-or change
  the entire world during Endgame: The Eclipse. Or, more importantly, you can have
  A Dance!
  .
  Players also collaborate on world-building elements to flesh out some Truths
  about the world, and can change them later during the endgame!
  .
  How similar is it to Firebrands?
  .
  This game follows the Firebrands Formula developed by Meguey and D. Vincent
  Baker, and while I was tempted to just "Find Mobile Frame Replace Dragon" I
  ended up doing... more than that. Most importantly, Dances are 50% longer! Also
  there are no coin flips or other mechanical randomizers. I've added several new
  games, and reworked the existing ones a bit to fit the setting. Also, wording
  and mechanics have been reworked to better facilitate interactions with more
  than two participants in certain games.
  .
  Generally speaking, one of the consentiest games ever is now even consentier,
  and more polyamory-friendly and trans-friendly.
  .
  Character Keeper
  .
  Originally written to be played in-person back when we could, uh, do that, I've
  made an updated Character Keeper to assist with playing this game online! (To
  find out how to make one for your own game, @GauntletRPG on Twitter has
  tutorials!)
  .
  You can open the Character Keeper at

  The current zine is no longer valid, as it was designed for 5th Edition before

  this game world over to the new OGL. Therefore, we will reissue a new version of
  this zine to all current owners as soon as possible as either rules-agnostic, or
  with rules that don't open us up to law suits or our creative work being stolen
  by a corporation.

  This is a small platform game starring our little pixel hero, Drake. This
  version is the full game. Purchasing the game will give you a downloadable
  version that you can keep forever.
  .
  The downloadable version comes in two flavors. A Windows executable for all
  modern flavors of windows, and a flash version that should work in any browser
  running flash.
  .
  PLEASE NOTE: The flash version has been discontinued due to the closure of Adobe
  Flash Player in modern web browsers.  I will not be updating it, but I will keep
  the version 1.0 flash game available for purchase and play for those without
  windows or on older systems.  So far the only missing features in the flash
  version are the pause and file select screens, so it's still very much enjoyable
  if you can run it.  Please remember to check your system to make sure you can
  run old flash games before purchasing if you don't have windows! - 12/12/2020
  .
  You will also get these:
  .
  No "please support" screen at start of game.
  .
  Pause game with P, and exit a stage in progress. (Windows version only, sorry.)
  .
  Play offline without any internet.
  .
  Keep a copy of Drake forever.
  .
  You can contact Gawain Doell at darkgrif@gmail.com with any feedback or support
  issues! I will also check in on the page comments if you prefer to leave some
  public feedback others can read!

  Updates:
  .
  12/25/2020
  .
  Minor update to 1.2 with a major fix for false positive antivirus detection.
  The game has been built with a new version of Clickteam Fusion that should
  correct the false positive detection from a lot of antivirus software.  If you
  had trouble downloading the windows version before, try version 1.2.  There are
  no other changes in this update.
  .
  12/12/2020
  .
  Update for 2020!
  .
  First the bad news, the flash version will be discontinued.  It is still
  playable on older systems, but modern web browsers don't like flash.  So I can't
  support it anymore moving forward.  It just takes too much time for me to test
  on windows and flash versions, so I will focus only on the Windows platform from
  now on.
  .
  Now some good news!  Drake for windows now has a file select screen!  Saves can
  be erased in game as well, so now you can truly restart the game and play again
  or speed run to your heart's content!
  .
  4/3/2017
  .
  Release of version 1.0. All game levels are included in both the web game and
  the downloadable version. If you buy the download version by donating you can
  play it offline and keep Drake forever.

  Dream Aflame is a GMless  three-player tabletop RPG in which you play as
  desperate survivors in a desolate land of magic and danger - and also as the
  land and its denizens.  In it, you are responsible for your own survival, and
  that of your Wicked triad. It's up to you to learn how well you handle that
  responsibility, and what relationships grow as a result. Will you learn strange
  secrets? Will you build something that can last? Will you simply survive,
  bickering and bitter all the while, or will something sweeter bloom from the
  toxic ground?

  The game uses the Belonging Outside Belonging system, famously originated in
  Avery Alder's game Dream Askew, and draws inspiration from a multitude of
  sources, including the video game Pyre and the music of The Dead South.

  We all know the scene, a group of Cowpokes gathered around a poker table,
  putting more than just money on the line. Their hopes, futures, burdens, and
  even their lives are often in the pot. A mix of fate and skill will determine
  what their next chapter will be... if they even have one. But honestly? Despite
  the risks, at least they can say they tried; that they put it all on the line
  for a dream of a better life. And now, dear reader, it's our turn to do the
  same.
  .
  Dream At High Noon is a poker based Tabletop Role-playing Game, focused on
  telling stories in the cowpoke fiction genre. It uses the mechanics and feelings
  of playing a game of poker to create an atmosphere reminiscent of the genre,
  empowering everyone at the table to take part in telling a story as a group that
  fits within the tropes and genre of cowpoke fiction.

  So, will you play your cards right, even when fate deals you a bad hand, or will
  they come tumbling down around you? Will High Noon see your dream come true, or
  will this be your final dawn?

developer: Nakade
publisher: Nakade
genre: Role Playing
description:
  In 1980 Khadath Games, a studio founded 2 years earlier, published their first
  role playing game, a small title known as Dream Quest. Notable for its limited
  mechanics, heavy focus on abstract theme, and seemingly ritual components, it
  was set upon by concerned parent groups and largely snubbed by critics. Shortly
  afterwards, Khadath Games folded and has since largely vanished into the dusty
  annals of history.
  .
  Today, we have uncovered Dream Quest, and present it to you in a digitised and
  playable form. The rules and mechanics remain unchanged, but we have cleaned up
  the presentation, remade the Sleeper Record, and are ready to incorporate more
  changes as you, the community, rediscover this lost classic. We hope you have as
  much fun playing it as we did when we were children.
  .
  - The Editors
  .
  What is Dream Quest?
  .
  Dream Quest is a re-publication of an RPG that never existed, from an 80s that
  never was. Uncover the mystery of this "lost classic", meant to simulate a
  shared lucid dream into a strange landscape dominated by the abstract, yet with
  terror bubbling beneath the surface. Your support will allow me to produce more
  documents surrounding the past (and future) of this game, uncovering its occult
  origins, sinister secrets, uncensored editions, and even the handwritten notes
  of the original creators of the current rendition.
  .
  Disclaimer: Dream Quest is not a real game from the 80s. Khadath Games is not a
  real company, and William Carter and J.C. are fictional personae. Any
  resemblance to persons alive or dead or historical events are purely
  coincidental. Dream Quest is copyright 2021 Nakade. All rights reserved.

  What do I get?
  .
  For 5 dollars, you will receive the full current edition of Dream Quest, and all
  future updates to the rules and itchfunding expansions.

  If this project reaches 20 dollars, I will release the "80s edition" of Dream
  Quest, showing the game in all of its retro glory (you can seee the retro cover
  as a preview). The text and art remains the same. RELEASED
  .
  If this project reaches 50 dollars, I will release the "playtest edition",
  containing extra content surrounding the dark forces that threaten the Trance,
  your shared dream-world. PENDING -> Playtest notes released
  .
  If this project reaches 100 dollars, I will release "handwritten notes" from the
  original creators, detailing various dream-world domains. PENDING -> Dream
  domain map and NPC controller released
  .
  If this project reaches 300 dollars, I will create 4 pages from the "occult
  text" Dream Quest is derived from.
  .
  If these goals are reached, please give me time to make them. They will likely
  be delivered over the next few weeks/months.

developer: Xavid
publisher: Xavid
genre: Card Game
description:
  This item includes only the rulebook (and handouts) for Dreampunk, not the deck
  of cards. The digital Dreampunk deck is available separately.
  .
  At night, you dream. Your dreams are not idle imaginings, but visits to a
  persistent world of wonders and dangers both personal and alien. Will you find
  power there? Will you find freedom? Or will you slowly slip into Entanglement,
  and be trapped there forever?
  .
  Play to find out!
  .
  Dreampunk is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players comprised of two parts:
  a rulebook and a deck of surreal art cards. Rather than the numerical randomness
  of dice, it uses these cards as both creativity prompts and a resource to power
  your special abilities. This item includes the rulebook only.
  .
  Your character is a Dreamer, someone from a waking world who is drawn to the
  Dream when they sleep. As a Dreamer, you have powerful abilities to shape the
  world around you. To do so, you must play a card and incorporate into your
  action an element of your choice from the card.
  .
  Dreampunk can be played with or without a dedicated Guide. By default, the Guide
  player, rather than play a Dreamer, portrays the world of the Dream and its
  denizens. Alternately, you may instead distribute the Guide role among all the
  players, so everyone both plays a Dreamer and shares responsibility for the
  world. Either way, Dreampunk uses the cards to encourage an improvisational
  style for inspiring challenges and obstacles, avoiding the need for detailed
  planning or prewritten adventures.
  .
  Dreamers can be any type of character you can imagine, and they're defined
  primarily not by their powers or skills but by the Needs that have entangled
  them with the Dream. Thirteen different Dreamer playbooks are available,
  reflecting different reasons for entering the Dream, as well as four deeper
  playbooks for characters with stranger origins. No matter your playbook, you are
  given wide room to creatively define your character, the world they come from,
  and their position in the Dream.
  .
  The mechanics for Dreampunk are heavily inspired by the token economy of Dream
  Askew and Dream Apart by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum as well as the
  zaniness and powerful abilities of Jenna Moran's works. The focus on art cards,
  however, creates a unique gameplay experience. By playing a card, you can use
  your Dreamer's lucid abilities to shape the Dream around you and overcome
  obstacles, defend yourself, or cause chaos. You draw cards when you falter
  against the Dream, when you use your tethers to the waking world, and when you
  awaken or find respite. The constantly-shifting array of cards prompts options
  that are never the same twice for both Dreamers and the Guide.

  .
  Drive to Hell is a Shoot 'Em Up game at heart, but it plays a little differently
  than usual. Enemies spawn from random locations outside the screen area, making
  the center of the screen your friend. This puts more pressure on players to
  utilize the entire screen in their playing style (rather than hanging out at the
  bottom/back of the play field which is typical in many other shooters), making
  the smart use of hard braking, Nitros, etc. key.
  .
  Drive to Hell also uses grounded vehicles rather than aerial, so you will have
  to take water obstacles, walls, etc. into consideration as well as your vehicle
  choice - trucks and armored cars aren't impeded by liquids (the hovercraft
  actually gains speed!) but they will have tougher time dodging enemy fire.
  .
  Each vehicle has a unique appearance and set of stats determining firing power,
  special attack duration, health, and size as well as its own personal special
  attack that works either offensively or defensively. This allows you to choose
  the perfect one for your play style, whether it's flying around the screen
  quickly in a fragile indy car or bulldozing through foes with a huge armored
  car.
  .
  You can listen to the soundtrack or download the Digital Album here on our
  BandCamp page.You'll have the option to immediately download of 8-track album in
  the high-quality format of your choice (MP3, FLAC, and more), plus unlimited
  mobile access using the free Bandcamp listening app.

  Will you help me connect a device?
  .
  Sorry, I don't provide support for anything besides the software itself. Before
  you purchase DrumBrain, you should ensure your peripheral is working, and
  recognized as a Game Controller (click here for details)
  .
  Will it work with [hardware/controller]?
  .
  If it's not listed above, it's not guaranteed to work. Before you purchase, make
  sure it connects to your PC and is recognized as a Game Controller (click here
  for details).
  .
  Will PS3 controllers work?
  .
  PS3 controllers may require additional 3rd party software (install at your own
  risk). I do not offer support for getting controllers setup on your computer.
  .
  Please ensure it works before purchasing!
  .
  TROUBLESHOOTING
  .
  I get an error message "The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCR110.dll
  was not found..." when I run DrumBrain.exe
  .
  This issue has been resolved, so if you are still getting it, please download
  the latest version.
  .
  I get an error message "OpenGL functions unsupported..." when I run
  DrumBrain.exe. What does this mean?
  .
  Update your video card drivers. If you've never done it, here's how.
  .
  Why do you need to do this? OpenGL drivers used to be provided with windows, but
  no longer. You must acquire them by updating your graphics adapter drivers.
  DrumBrain will work after you've done this, and you will also benefit from
  having up-to-date drivers.
  .
  When I hit a pad, there's an audible delay/latency. Can I do anything to improve
  this?
  .
  Maybe. Ensure you are using a WASAPI audio device. Go into the menu Settings >
  Audio, and test the devices under WASAPI tab. This audio API is low latency
  (high performance), but you won't be able to hear any other audio while you have
  Drum Brain using a WASAPI device.
  .
  If you still hear a noticeable delay, then your CPU may be too slow to run
  DrumBrain.

  What's Dual Pong?
  .
  Dual Pong is a skill-based 2D sports game that stays true to what made the
  original Pong game a success, while also bringing some new ideas to the table.
  .
  What Does This Game Have To Offer?
  .
  - A Story Mode with 16 possible endings
  .
  - A Singles Mode
  .
  - A Team Mode
  .
  - A Battle Mode
  .
  - A Classic Pong Mode
  .
  - An AI that can adapt to your skill level
  .
  - A dynamic ball collision system
  .
  - Versatile and responsive controls
  .
  - Multiplayer that can go up to 4 players
  .
  - And More
  .
  Note: This game can be played with a keyboard, a Xbox 360 controller, or a Xbox
  One controller.
  .
  More Info From The Game Creator
  .
  Dual Pong has a more methodical gameplay style than the original Pong game.
  Players have to focus not only on their defense, but also on their offense if
  they want to improve their chances of winning. The player's offense is
  determined by which key or button the player presses while a ball is colliding
  with their paddle. This gives the player more control over which hitting
  techniques they use in different situations during the game. The versatile
  controls in this game allow the player to control the offense in a variety of
  both familiar and unfamiliar ways. Players can choose and change up their
  controls on the fly by deciding which combination of keys or buttons they want
  to use in real-time.
  .
  With the exception of the Classic Pong game event, all of the rest of the game
  events in this game requires the player to focus their defense and offense on 2
  balls during gameplay instead of just one. This can create situations where the
  player can be on offense and defense at the same time, and it can also create
  situations where the player might be temporarily overwhelmed by 2 balls moving
  towards their side of the screen at the same time; which can possibly become
  more difficult to deal with depending on whether or not certain ball collisions
  happen during these situations. There are 16 possible ball collisions that can
  happen when the 2 balls collide with each other. These possible ball collisions
  are determined by which direction the 2 balls are moving in, and also what speed
  the 2 balls are moving at when they collide with each other. There are also
  other possible collisions that can happen (even during the Classic Pong game
  event) when a ball collides with a paddle; which can either result in the ball
  "staying in play" or "going out of play". Players will only be able to use their
  offense on a ball if it stays in play.
  .
  The AI will adapt to the player's skill level based on how well the player is
  performing in the game. Although the AI can adapt to the player's skill level,
  the AI will never become unbeatable. The player just needs to figure out a way
  to beat the AI. If the player figures out a way to beat the AI in each of the
  game events, they can choose to play against other players who have done the
  same in order to find their next level of challenge. The AI in this game is
  smart and was designed to have a similar play style to some of the players. The
  AI is also capable of making split decisions when necessary. In addition to a
  smart and adaptive AI, this game also has some hidden in-game strategies and
  easter eggs; but I want the players to discover them on their own.

description:
  Duelist is a combat add-on for tabletop roleplaying games, intended to add depth
  and variety to a wide range of most popular TTPRG games without replacing their
  mechanics. Instead, Duelist aims to work with the already existing game systems,
  to further bring out the fun of combat.
  .
  Using Duelist in your games is going to help your fighter characters of all
  classes and variations express themselves through a combat style, and be more
  effective against foes at the same time. Duelist isn't a direct power upgrade
  for your fighters, however, as the increased effectiveness comes at the cost of
  potential drawbacks.
  .
  To accomplish those goals through the use of a simple system of semi-random
  selection and multiple convergent stances and attack types. The players can
  choose theirs at will, while the non-player character opponents choose theirs
  either through Game Master/Dungeon Master fiat or through a simple semi-random
  selection method-the decision roll.
  .
  What's inside?
  .
  Tips for mixing Duelist with any RPG combat system
  .
  Rules for engaging in duels
  .
  Decision roll: a semi-random algorithm to simulate the opposition's intelligence
  and tactics
  .
  New initiative rules
  .
  Three stances affecting your defense and offense potential
  .
  Three types of attacks varying the speed and damage
  .
  Six combat moves introducing offensive and defensive maneuvers
  .
  Six bonus moves, from taunts to refreshments and dirty tricks!

  Duelist is the first in the series of system-neutral add-ons by Double

  ALSO AVAILABLE: Dungeon Hero Volume 2: Giant Beasts, and Dungeon Hero Volume
  Three: Bump in the Night, two more collections of four new adventures each.
  .
  Dungeon Hero is a simple, fast, solitaire RPG game in a print-and-play "zine"
  format.
  .
  Create a hero using eight defining characteristics, like Archer of the Realm or
  Chainmail or Stealthy.  Assign them dice ranging from d12 to d6. Note your
  Health and Stamina levels, and then select an adventure 'zine.
  .
  Each adventure 'zine packs a lot of adventure for such a little size! Using a
  clever new exploration mechanic, each foray into the dungeon will offer
  different challenges using a simple combination of two dungeon elements.  Select
  two of your own traits and roll off against the two dungeon elements, and see if
  you can beat the dangerous situation.  If you roll well, you survive to continue
  deeper.  If you fail, you will take damage. But don't despair - you can spend
  Stamina to re-roll dice before you apply their effects!
  .
  If you can make it through the dungeon, you win! Your score is how many
  treasures you manage to bring out of the dungeon - see if you can beat your high
  score by playing again!
  .
  Volume One of Dungeon Hero contains three eight-page 'zines that you print out,
  cut, and fold yourself:
  .
  Dungeon Hero Core Rules - The core rulebook for playing Dungeon Hero. Explains
  the rules for character creation and gameplay, and provides an example of play.
  .
  Castle Charon - Robed cultists have been seen filing into the ruins of King
  Charon's castle. Chanting has been heard, and demons have been sighted. Can you
  set things right?
  .
  Fortress of the Frost Giant Jarl - Freezing and starving, you find a Viking
  outpost, but to stay with them for the winter, you must help them put down the
  Frost Giant jarl.
  .
  The PDF's come in two formats:
  .
  A Volume format containing the pages for all three booklets that you can fold
  into the booklet as shown in the video.
  .
  Standalone versions that you can reference on digital devices or print for a
  non-folding reference sheet.
  .
  This video shows how to fold the Volume format printings into 'zine booklets:
  .
  If you like Dungeon Hero, be sure to check out Fable on your Table, which is a
  deeper, more detailed version of the system used in Dungeon Hero.
  .

  Welcome to Dwerg Saga and a world of deep storytelling. Guide your clan of
  Dwergs as they establish a new home in the untamed wilderness. Watch as they
  forge friendships, sing tales of their forefathers, suffer the pangs of
  unrequited love, take up arms and seek adventure wherever you take them.
  .
  Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Dwerg Saga aims to create dramatic and believable
  stories from the interactions between Dwergs, their environment and what they
  build. Dwerg Saga is being designed with usability as a key feature so it's easy
  to pick up and play.
  .
  Multiplayer games are possible on a Local Area Network (LAN). The persistent,
  shared-universe of Dwerg Saga (the Cloud Service) is currently disabled. In the
  Cloud Service, when you connect to a game, the world is specific to your real-
  world location. Other players in the same location can play in the same world at
  the same time and whatever you build will still be there when you come back to
  that location.
  .
  The Cloud Service has been disabled until funding goals are achieved.

  This game is available to $3-tier Patreon supporters.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Hidden beneath the surface there's another layer to the world. Supernatural
  creatures roam the shadows, living among and integrating into society as
  humankind expands into every corner they used to have to themselves. It was only
  a matter of time, then, before they found their way into our hospitals.
  .
  Looking for help.
  .
  The Eldritch Care Unit is a medical program that runs alongside the mundane
  hospitals and medical centers throughout the country. You play those doctors,
  nurses, occultists, and other staff members that seek to do whatever they can to
  cure the supernaturally sick population, despite the difficulties of
  incomprehensive insurance, short-staffing, and lack of funding.
  .
  It's not easy to do this job. But you swore an Oath.
  .
  And it's magically binding.
  .
  The Game
  .
  Eldritch Care Unit is a unique RPG taking place in the hidden supernatural wing
  that's present in hospitals across the United States, wherein players take on
  the roles of overworked doctors, nurses, ritualists, researchers, and other
  staff members, doing their absolute best to provide the care they can to the
  patients that come in. Said patients are inherently supernatural by nature or
  affliction, and so these rare specialists are the only ones who have a hope of
  fixing them up.
  .
  This book contains:
  .
  Information on the Eldritch World that these ECUs exist within.
  .
  A unique new resolution mechanic, the Adversarial System, which relies on
  withstanding external hardships more than testing your own capability directly.
  .
  Example patients and advice to get you started.
  .
  A fillable character sheet.
  .
  ECU is also San Jenaro Co-op Approved, guaranteeing that it was produced in fair
  conditions by forward-thinking people!

  WELCOME TO EEK3!

  After they demolished the mall, the old dirt patch on the edge of town stayed
  untended for coming up on two years. Until tonight.
  .
  On the way back from a late-night walk you passed by the familiar vacant spot -
  only to find that it was vacant no longer. A cubic monolith of glass and steel,
  stretching heavenward, stood where that morning there had been nothing. From
  within - bright lights, electric sounds, bitcrushed music. And the very faint
  echo of shrieks and moans.
  .
  It's late already. Looks like you'll be coming home a little later still...

  .
  "Indie game developer ceMelusine makes brief, simple games that offer the player
  poignant moments of loneliness." - Leigh Alexander (Offworld)
  .
  "As simple as the gameplay is, every time I boot it up, I find myself hypnotized
  by the atmosphere and the language. There's something about Oracle that feels
  oddly grand and ancient." - Danielle Riendeau (Polygon)
  .
  "Like the declarations of Mountain, I find the symbols and prophecies pleasing
  to contemplate; they're little focuses for reflection." - Alice O'Connor (Rock
  Paper Shotgun)
  .
  "The games juxtapose the arcane and the comfortable, asking you to find meaning
  and purpose." - Heather Alexandra (Kotaku)
  .
  But ceMelusine! I can't afford to pay for these games/am press!
  .
  That's totally cool. I still want you to play the games, so feel free to email
  me at ceMelusine (at) gmail.com and tell me which games you are interested in
  playing. I'll will totally hook you up with a copy. Also maybe follow me on the

  Story description
  .
  Ecchi Sketch: Draw Cute Girls Every Day follows the story of Yume Akiyama, a
  girl in her mid twenties who works at a real 'dead-end' job - at a funeral
  company. Her real passion, however, is anything girl x girl - manga, anime,
  videogames; if it has cute girls romancing other cute girls, then she's a fan.
  .
  A talented amateur artist, Yume is suddenly given the opportunity of a lifetime
  - to be a mangaka at a manga studio! But with so many other attractive girls at
  the office... will she be able to concentrate?
  .
  Characters Yume Akiyama
  .
  Yume Akiyama, the heroine of our story, is a graphic designer at a funeral
  company. She's also a highly talented manga artist and is a superfan of anything
  girl x girl, be it manga, anime or video games.
  .
  Yume's mother died while she was young, so now she lives with her Dad, a high
  powered executive at Miyuhara Industries.
  .
  Kyoko Miyuhara
  .
  Kyoko Miyuhara is heir to the Miyuhara fortune. Her father is the president of
  Miyuhara Industries, a national company on the Nikkei stock exchange.
  .
  After a chance meeting with Yume, Kyoko reveals she runs her own company -
  Shirayuri Media who create girl x girl manga and doujinshi.
  .
  Rin
  .
  Rin is the jack of all trades at Shirayuri Media. From shading, to cleaning and
  colouring, Rin handles the odd jobs. Obsessed with pink, magical girls, and all
  things cute, Rin often comes across bratty and immature. Underneath, however,
  she hides a heart of gold.
  .
  Megumi
  .
  Megumi is a talented storyteller, a hobbyist musician and deep thinker. She
  often loses herself in her own thoughts... sometimes in the midst of
  conversation.
  .
  She often questions her place in the world, and can come across a little
  abrasive. Her personal life is a closely guarded secret. Features Partial voice
  acting across 3 major routes. An original soundtrack. 20+ unique CGs

  Peace. Kids playing in mech wreckage. A ghost.
  .
  One last journey across an ancient battleground to find a pilot's final resting
  place.
  .
  A GM-less storytelling and map-drawing game for 3 or more players.*
  .
  About how we remember war, how we forget, and all that remains when the echoes
  fade.
  .
  1-3 hours to play (usually 2+ hours if more than 4 players).
  .
  4 pages (excluding cover and hex map).
  .
  3 random tables for creating an advanced or low-tech landscape littered with
  destroyed mechs from the last great war.
  .
  An optional blank hex map is also available to download and print.
  .
  You will need to bring your own pencils or crayons for drawing the map, and a
  6-sided die would be useful, but not necessary.
  .
  * 1-on-1 play is also possible. See ECH0_1-on-1.txt.
  .
  This game was inspired by the wreckage of a downed Japanese Zero fighter I came
  across in the Sabah countryside when I was a kid. The stripped fuselage had been
  lying there for nearly 40 years. A lonely, fallen engine of destruction.
  .
  Once, a pilot depended upon the machine for his life. I wonder what conversation
  I might have had with his ghost. I wonder if the wreck is still there.
  .
  Also available in French along with The Ech0 Consultation!
  .
  Also available as a free Korean-language demo thanks to ttrprsn666! See below!

developer: Saevrick
publisher: Saevrick
genre: Adventure;Role Playing
description:
  I'm just tired of everything... even the echoes.
  .
  There is nothing in my life but echoes...
  .
  Echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys.
  .
  They're beautiful and mocking.
  .
  L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Avonlea
  .
  In time,
  .
  everyone fades away,
  .
  transfiguring into
  .
  echoes that latch
  .
  onto our memories
  .
  and bleed our hearts dry.
  .
  Barbara Garay, Beneath the Surface: A Book of Poems
  .
  __________________________________________________________
  .
  Echoes is a game about atonement or damnation.  A game about fear and the
  obscure and resilience in the face of adversity both physically and mentally.
  You will explore the suppressed and repressed aspects of your mind and either
  project them into your new reality or deny them by projecting them into others.
  .
  You are a lone soul lost in a mysterious town searching for what remains of a
  loved one who has long since gone beyond the world.  Mysterious creatures roam
  the mists surrounding the city, turning it into a cage, and supernatural forces
  rule over the streets and alleys.  The echoes of your past latch onto you and
  challenge you at every turn.
  .
  You are alone.
  .
  You are afraid.
  .
  You are without hope.
  .
  Maybe if you survive, you'll learn something about your true self.
  .
  __________________________________________________________
  .
  Echoes is a solo journaling game where you write or record your story, using
  only a six-sided die and a deck of cards which provide prompts to get your mind
  engaged. You may get attacked during the night, recall memories from you and
  your loved one's past, or answer deep questions about your own morality.  Echoes
  is deadly--but you can also add a block tower to make the deadly even deadlier.
  .
  __________________________________________________________
  .
  Disclaimer: There are themes of death, gore, violence, loss of agency and mental
  degradation that some players may find disturbing. Discretion is advised.
  Themes are heavily influenced in horror genres such as Silent Hill and Resident
  Evil.
  .
  This game was created as part of the Wretched & Alone Jam, a game jam organised
  to coincide with the release of the SRD for the Wretched & Alone system, based
  on Chris Bissette's game The Wretched.

  don't understand. The combat is based on reaction rather than action.
  Strategically, you will need to manage your stamina and position in order to
  master the art of parry or to find the perfect time to strike. Visually inspired
  by classic 16 and 8 bit games, Elden: Path of the Forgotten is a stunning,
  encapsulating, dark world waiting to be explored.

  The Electric Zine Maker is a printshop and art tool for making zines.
  .
  This tool includes a drawing interface. You can import images, size and place,
  write text with any font that you have installed, smudge, paint, and a number of
  other options. You can also save your zines, and easily re-import them by
  dragging the saved zine folder back into the main menu. It is built with
  collaboration in mind.
  .
  The Electric Zine Maker has a new beautiful website where you can learn more
  about it! Click here to visit it.

  macOS users that have trouble opening the Electric Zine Maker (the file keeps

  Windows users that have trouble saving their Zines (or other issues) please read

  If you liked The Electric Zine Maker please consider paying for it so I can
  cover development costs and make money from it. Thank you kindly.
  .
  The Electric Zine Maker is still under development!!!
  .
  This is an early beta.
  .
  Be gentle! It has early beta feelings!!!  !??
  .
  More art tools are being built for it.
  .
  There are a number of bugs. It is rough around a few edges.
  .
  You can read more about what is planned for it here.
  .
  The Electric Zine Maker is planned to be an "art toy". It's a playful tool with
  which you can create cute little things. The finished version will feature a
  silly little back-story, and other characters, maybe even some small game-like
  interactions to build a story around it, so that it's an all around playful
  piece of freeware.
  .
  Things planned:
  .
  * Many strange and interesting art-tools for the drawing interface
  .
  * Bugs need to be fixed and the UI's still need more work
  .
  * A back story, and little characters that reinforce the fictional universe it
  is placed in.
  .
  * A number of other art-tools (that are packaged with it), that allow you to
  create effects and glitch art for your zines.
  .
  * Clip art will be bundled with the Zine Maker so you have more art to work
  with.
  .
  Things from other devs:
  .
  * Jeremy Oduber made an html template for turning zines made with the Electric
  Zine Maker into a web ready html zine (web zines!). You can host those on itch.
  It's easy to use! Check it out: https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine

  Kind Words:
  .
  "I think that just about everything Nathalie Lawhead makes is wonderfully
  energetic, raw, and approachable. Top of the charts, for me, is their Electric
  Zine Maker project, which makes single-page-zine creation a breeze."
  .
  - by Kat Brewster on Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "The arrival of this software into my life restored a sense of play to my
  creative practice and brought back a flame I thought had dimmed for good. It
  gave me the courage, too, to send scrappy, earnest writing to the people who
  wanted to read it, without the intense pressure of online publishing or the
  quick-fire takes of social media."
  .
  - by Sarah Maria Griffin on The Guardian
  .
  "What Lawhead and the Electric Zine Maker suggest is that seriousness is not
  always the best way to fight back against a system that doesn't care about you;
  choosing lightness, lack of coherence, silliness and restful creation can be
  just as effective."
  .
  - by Nicole Froio on The Observer
  .
  "Zines und OpenSource passen wunderbar zueinander, findet Nathalie Lawhead und
  entwickelt seit 2018 den Electric Zine Maker. Nun ist ein groes Update fr das

description:
  It's said that somewhere, hidden from all but the most determined explorers,
  there is a miniature world where one may go to escape the worries of life. After
  falling from the sky, you've found yourself in that very same miniature world.
  But now that you're there, can you ever return home again?

  art world, meet a colourful cast of characters, and more! While exploring the
  miniature world, you'll discover a wide array of unique rooms and puzzles to
  solve using your Items, all of which give you various abilities; grow vines to
  reach high places, dash over seemingly bottomless pits, dive into uncharted
  waters, and lift the heaviest obstacles with ease! But beware; there are also
  strange and powerful beings in this magical world, many of whom won't give up
  their Gems willingly! It'll take all of your abilities, wits, and skill to
  gather enough Gems to reach the Tower!

  Ellipses RPG makes tabletop role-playing more accessible than ever by focusing
  on chaotic, collaborative storytelling - not number crunching.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Streamlined, Adaptable, Accessible Ruleset
  .
  The mechanics of Ellipses RPG fit within only 3 pages of text, and are designed
  to work with any setting you can imagine. Role-playing newcomers can create a
  character within 15 minutes! Additionally, if you find yourself wanting more or
  less complexity, the Ellipses ruleset has built-in points of adaptability so you
  can create your ideal role-playing environment.
  .
  It's also free.
  .
  Innovative Event and Effect System
  .
  Ellipses RPG's innovative Event and Effect (or Log) system allows you to
  continue building your character long after their original creation. The
  experiences of your character, and the decisions you make, have a continuing
  effect on your journey through a campaign. Again, this isn't a system focused on
  numbers, stats, and complex abilities. It's about you, and the stories you
  create with others.
  .
  Did I mention that it's free?
  .
  Session Starters Manual with Scenario Ideas!
  .
  If you choose to donate and support this system - first of all, thank you. Along
  with my undying gratitude, you'll receive the Session Starters manual. This
  guide won't provide complete, pre-built worlds for you to explore. Instead, it
  contains over 30 separate scenario ideas to spur your own, customized
  adventures.
  .
  From a Victor Frankenstein/Dracula team-up to a quest to gain the trust of a
  sentient castle, I hope these strange universes help spark your imagination, and
  get a full-blown role-playing session started that much faster!
  .
  ----------
  .
  CHANGELOG:
  .
  8-14-18: Inspired by playing an absolutely irresponsible amount of Yakuza 0 and
  falling in love with the absurd, sincere, human stories you participate in as a
  Crime Dad, I've added a scenario to Ellipses about solving problems in 1920s
  Chicago as bada** Mobster Moms.
  .
  You're welcome.
  .
  -
  .
  6-15-18:  In the biggest update for the system yet, the rules for Ellipses have
  been comprehensively rewritten for clarity and profit, the game now has a proper
  logo that also looks gorgeous,  and the Session Starters manual has 11 new
  scenarios written by some of the best writers in gaming (and me!).
  .
  Many thanks to Raven Stark for her incredible art skills, and this update's
  awesome scenario contributors: Laura Michet, Hannah Powell-Smith, Tea-Powered
  Games, Cash DeCuir, Cat Manning, Kevin Snow, Heather Robertson, Katherine
  Morayati, and Kristin Ruff-Frederickson!
  .
  -
  .
  7-14-17: This update brings the total number of Session Starters over 20 with 5
  new scenarios. Go to a barbecue as aliens wearing the skin of a suburban family
  in 1950s America! Take your eldritch spawn to their first day of school in
  Necrodadicon!
  .
  Not to toot my own horn, but this is my favorite series of additions yet.
  .
  -
  .
  5-7-17: Added 2 new, religion-focused scenarios to the Session Starters manual.
  Update includes giant spiders, Victorian nightmares, and italics.
  .
  -
  .
  4-19-17: Added 5 new scenarios to the Session Starters manual, including 2
  Jacked 2 Hack, a cyberpunk hacking, punching fantasy, and SkeleCaddies. The
  latter is, of course, about skeleton caddies assisting the future ruler of the
  Underworld in the most dangerous golf match of all time.
  .
  Obviously.

developer: Quarter Onion Games, mbhahn
publisher: Quarter Onion Games, mbhahn
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Emberlight is a true roguelite dungeon crawler, set in a world where the Gods
  have given you a great gift - and a great curse.
  .
  Explore procedurally generated dungeons as a Knight of the Ember Order. Conquer
  the quests set out before your party, and uncover the lore of the land. Grow
  your strength by absorbing the abilities of your slain enemies and collecting
  the powerful traits of dungeon bosses.
  .
  Become strong, become quick, become immortal - but be warned - as you fight
  using unstable Ember powers, they will begin to corrupt and twist your very
  soul. Every gift of power has its sacrifice; every ability has its cost.
  .
  As the Gods fight for control of their creations, you must decide what is good,
  and what is evil. To protect your people against the dangers of Ember power, you
  must use its power to your advantage. Will you conquer the dark, or will you
  lose yourself to corruption?
  .
  ABSORB
  .
  As a Knight of the Ember Order, you have the ability to absorb the abilities
  used by your enemies.  Every ability used by enemies has a chance to be learned.
  This allows customization of each character towards whichever goals you have.
  But each absorbed ability has a cost...
  .
  CORRUPT
  .
  Every absorbed ability will corrupt your soul.  You will slowly lose yourself to
  evil as the quest progresses.  This expresses itself in unstable corruption
  traits which leads to metamorphosis into an evil being (such as a lich).  And
  you will lose yourself to the corruption...
  .
  REPEAT
  .
  Each run will last between 30-60 minutes.  After completing the quest, the most
  corrupted will kill off his former allies in an epic battle.  This corrupted
  being will then begin attracting evil around them, and will act as a boss in a
  future quest once their influence has expanded enough.  They will have all the
  powers you have provided them during the run, providing a never ending challenge
  in future runs.  For every corrupted boss, a stronger party is required to
  defeat them.  And the cycle repeats......forever?

  HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIND OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?
  .
  We here at ENIGMA TECHNOLOGIES have created a revolutionary new tool to help us
  find out.
  .
  With DREAMSCAPE, we can represent the mind of an AI through an interactive 3D
  environment that we can explore!
  .
  [CAUTION]
  .
  As the DREAMSCAPE is a reflection of an AI's mental state, be aware that the
  DREAMSCAPE of a contaminated AI could become unpredictable.
  .
  No need to worry however, as this recruitment exercise is only a simulation of
  what a real DREAMSCAPE would look like.
  .
  This exercise serves to train people like you to become effective RADE agents.
  What does RADE stand for, you ask? Simple. It stands for Ro-[[DATA REDACTED]]
  .
  [DESCRIPTION]
  .
  THE ENIGMA MACHINE is a short first-person science fiction horror game that aims
  to capture the obscurity and unpredictability of games of old, framed within an
  increasingly unsettling presentation.
  .
  A unique fusion of glitchy mid-90's 3D graphics and VHS effects with more modern
  graphical effects for a distinctive visual style.
  .
  A series of puzzles which force you to think outside the box.
  .
  A blend of traditional first-person controls combined with point-and-click
  mechanics for satisfying interaction with the world.
  .
  A story that could only be told through the medium of games
  .
  AVERAGE PLAY TIME: 60-90 MINUTES
  .
  (One last thing. The game isn't over until you see the credits. :) )
  .
  [REVIEWS]
  .
  "There are some offers I can't refuse. "Would you like to poke around inside the
  mind of an unstable AI?" is one of them, and the 15 minutes I've spent so far
  with The Enigma Machine have made me glad I seized the opportunity."

description:
  What is Eros System: Core Rules?
  .
  This is the core ruleset for the Eros RPG system. The rules contained in this
  book are the basis for any number of games that can be played using this 2d6
  game mechanic. Specific background, rules, equipment, and other content for each
  game is released in a separate supplement.
  .
  Why is it called the "Eros System"?
  .
  It's named after the flagship game setting using this game system: Eros 433, a
  science fiction setting named after an actual asteroid, fictionally turned into
  an interstellar colony ship. It's not primarily intended for mature
  content...but you could go there if you really want to write your own supplement
  for it.
  .
  What's so special about this system?
  .
  TL,DR: Fast game mechanic, complex character creation, crunchy combat rules
  .
  The basic game mechanic is simple, covers almost all dice rolls made in game,
  and only requires standard six-sided dice. At the same time, it has enough
  complexity to develop complicated characters.
  .
  Combat complexity in the system finds the middle ground between being bogged
  down in number crunching using endless tables and being so quick and abstract
  that it isn't really very descriptive.
  .
  There are several combat rule variants to choose from to suit your group's
  preferred style of play, balancing speed of combat resolution with the "feel" of
  descriptive combat mechanics.

  WARNING:
  .
  May contain some loud and prolonged low/high pitch moments and unsettling
  atmosphere/elements. May also contain some flashing lights moments!!
  .
  Tem here!!! It's my first time making an RPGmaker game!! Its my first time
  trying to put together my own project outside of an animated thing (though... I
  guess this is still sort of.. that..).  I've always wanted to make an RPGMaker
  game, though I guess it isn't much of a game. Its around 15-20 minutes long
  (though I guess it could be longer if you try to get all the endings).
  .
  There's around 4 different endings you can get.
  .
  A small warning that one of the endings is a little creepy/unsettling.. But
  hopefully its not too much.  Also... occasionally a movie might freeze... I'm
  not really sure what causes this, if it happens, try restarting the game. I'm
  sorry if this happens :( It seems like this has been working for some people as
  a fix, so you could give it a try! https://itch.io/t/432226/found-a-way-to-fix-

  Thank you for stopping by!! I hope you like it!! I'll try to make more one day.

  look nothing alike. This game is also not an attempt to represent the whole of
  my experiences. It's just showing little parts.

  Players build the estate by dividing the deck by color. The black cards
  represent rooms with encounters, puzzles, or random effects. The red cards
  represent items and treasures that you receive for successfully resolving
  encounters.
  .
  Many encounters can be resolved in three ways: FIGHT, ESCAPE, and CHARM. Players
  roll 2d6, add any bonuses or boons, and attempt to beat the number indicated.
  Items you pick up can help you, and you can choose a character at the beginning
  with bonuses in these stats to suit your play style.
  .
  It is highly encouraged to print this game so you can easily flip through the
  references.
  .
  The FIGHT, ESCAPE, and CHARM mechanics are loosely based off of the Tunnel Goons
  system by Nate Treme. All art used is in the public domain.

game: Even Gods Must Die (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/E/Even Gods Must Die (USA)/Even Gods Must Die (USA).json
developer: Rat Wave Game House
publisher: Rat Wave Game House
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Note
  .
  This game is no longer available for sale. If your accessing this it's likely
  because you purchased it in a bundle previously. It was formerly known as Old
  Gods and Young Guns but for clarities sake it has now been renamed. This is due
  to the fact that the title and concept (Jack Kirby's Fourth World meets a space
  western) was reused for the setting guide Old Gods and Young Guns. It is not
  accurate to say that the currently available Old Gods and Young Guns is a second
  addition as it is an entirely different thing that uses a similar starting
  point, a system agnostic setting guide compared to a proof-of-concept storygame.
  .
  The game is only available in it's plain text form as I have since changed the
  name I publish under and I don't have the desire to redo the PDFs given it's
  lack of availability.
  .
  Even Gods Must Die
  .
  There came a time when the Old Gods died! The wild died with the weary! The
  magnificent perished, locked in battle with the unforgivable! It was the last
  day for them! An ancient era was passing in a Great Disaster!
  .
  Now in a world after theirs, young gunslingers carve out a living on the
  Meteoric Planes. Bounty hunters and bandits drifting through asteroid towns.
  Lawmen appointed by mining corps barons enforcing their iron grip. Labourers
  being pushed to breaking point ready to take destiny into their own hands.
  Preachers looking for legacies of Old Gods in the dust. Truth is the only
  reliable professions on the belt are undertakers and bartenders.
  .
  Old Gods and Young Guns is a marble-based story game. It is a game in dyad. It
  is a GMfull game for three to seven players. You will require a set of marbles
  (10-15 marbles which can be split in two and marbles to act as shooters) and
  somewhere to use them. You'll also benefit from something to write on and
  something to write with.
  .
  In the first phase of the game, The Time of the Old Gods, you play a game of
  marbles which you use to define the Cosmic and Chthonic Gods, doomed gods
  inspired by the work of Jack Kirby. You tell their story and leave behind the
  world you'll play in during the second phase of the game.
  .
  The second phase of the game, The Dangerous Lives of the Young Guns, uses the
  marbles you scored in the first face to make an asymmetric token system. You
  play gunslingers living in the Meteoric Planes, the devasted remains of the Old
  Gods' world, who wield dangerous weapons containing the power of the Old Gods.
  .
  The game was initially conceived of for one-shot play, however it may work as a
  short campaign of multiple sessions, depending on your session length
  preferences.
  .
  Get your shooter ready.
  .
  The Olivia Hill Rule
  .
  If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the
  rules. If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree
  with a fascist," then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing
  inferences from context and acknowledging a dangerous political climate that
  causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. Don't play this game. Heal yourself.
  Grow. Learn. Watch some Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood or something.
  .
  Content Warnings and Safety Considerations
  .
  Old Gods and Young Guns is a game that fundamentally involves violence and is
  likely to involve violence between player characters. The Time of the Old Gods
  phase deals with the death of the characters you create. The exact form this
  takes and the detail of such is player-controlled, be considerate of each other
  and understanding as you find the level you're all comfortable with.
  .
  The Dangerous Lives of the Young Guns phase is a essentially space western. The
  western genre is soaked with racism and misogyny, be thoughtful of the tropes
  you deploy in your game and how else you can avoid replicating this hate.
  .
  Engaging with the western genre means engaging with this and engaging with the
  genre's relationship with settler colonialism. Settler colonialism enacts and
  perpetuates generations of injustice and cruelty. The setting of the game is a
  science fantasy setting that does not have a relationship to the history of
  Earth. We did not create sci-fi/fantasy analogues of Indigenous people and
  cultures as that is not something we felt comfortable or even qualified to do,
  as a white designer. This does mean however we've written a western setting
  without Indigenous peoples. That gives us pause. It is worth thinking about how
  this can affect your experience of play and how best to be kind and patient with
  each other.

developer: Phoebe Shalloway
publisher: Phoebe Shalloway
genre: Adventure
description:
  In a distant future in which capitalism and consumerism have continued to run
  rampant, corporations have replaced all government, and planet Earth has long
  been relegated to legend, society constantly moves to new planets and throws
  away the old ones like last year's model of smartphone.
  .
  You are a guest at the launch party for the most recently developed planet:
  Arcadia. Over the course of the evening you will wander the Arcadia Botanical
  Gardens' various rooms and eavesdrop on the other distinguished guests whose
  stories and dramas play out in a repeating cycle.
  .
  The Gardens claim to recreate the natural world of "prelaunch" Earth, a world no
  one has experienced in thousands of years. The game explores humanity's
  relationship to nature under capitalism, speculating on what "nature" would look
  when completely constructed by humans, and prompting the question of how close
  we may already be to such a reality.
  .
  I studied media studies at Vassar College, class of 2018, and this game was
  originally created as my senior thesis. You can learn more about the theory
  behind Even in Arcadia in my thesis's written component.

  at your own pace, you can leave the conversations that reference these topics

  An emotional journey. A character's inner monologue.
  .
  This is my first game ever. So apologies for the mistakes.
  .
  I made it up for the Solo journaling RPG jam and a couple more jams.
  .
  It's a narrative (journaling) game, as much as it is a tool to create a
  character's emotional backstory, his/her/its personality. Or... it can be as
  well a sort of meditation on your own past and future life through the present
  moment.
  .
  What is this and what is it useful for?
  .
  This solo game is also a resource for creating/telling stories and it can be
  used to inspire you, meditate about your past or that of a character or another
  person (real or ficticious) whose backstory you want to imagine, make up or
  figure out.
  .
  It can be used as a one-shot or on successive sessions, to link and build a
  lifetime of memories, thoughts and emotions, not only referred to the past, but
  also to the present and the future as well.
  .
  The protagonist of this emotional journey is a character in a story to whom you
  want to discover the emotional background and personality.
  .
  You want to surface her character or forge it for her, in the case it wasn't
  obvious; briefly, to behold everything that has made (will make) her who she is,
  what determines his behaviour and the way he acts and thinks, shaped by his past
  and present, as well as conditioned by his perception of the future.
  .
  You can also be yourself the character, be the protagonist of your own story, in
  a kind of meditative review of what has brought you up to this moment, including
  what you expect (or not) from the future.
  .
  TDLR
  .
  Short and to-the-point explanation of the mechanism
  .
  Roll on the three tables Evocation (Emotional Journey), Context, and Moment in
  time and create a memory, an evocation of the past, or a premonition, an omen of
  something future. From there, roll on the Evocation (Emotional journey) table
  and follow the instructions, to roll on one or several of the different tables
  .
  Let the story itself or the awakening character to guide you and lead you by the
  hand.
  .
  Link the new memory or premonition to the previous one, so that the emotional
  journey has coherence.
  .
  Or don't do any of the above and follow your own rules: it's you who plays,
  after all.
  .
  Note!
  .
  It still needs some more playtesting to improve it and polish it. I will be
  upgrading it frequently with my own experience playing it and with the feedback
  of the players. I must correct the margins and legibility; feel free to offer
  your comments.
  .
  In addition, I will upload very soon the Spanish original version and a detailed
  example of use of both the playing result and the podcast narrated and recorded
  by me of the final text created from the play example. In Spanish, though.
  .
  Visit my page Solo Historias for more information about how I use this and other
  creators' games to seed and write stories. Follow me on the social media to get
  ib touch with me.
  .
  Adapt it and create your own version or improve mine with your contributions
  .
  I will continue developing this game and system, since I use it to create my own
  stories.
  .
  Feel free to contribute any comment, improvement or criticism.
  .
  Or create your own version, if you prefer.

  your own version and distribute it for free or for a price, but you should refer

game: Ex Novo (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/E/Ex Novo (USA)/Ex Novo (USA).json
developer: Sharkbomb Studios, Martin Nerurkar, Konstantinos D.
publisher: Sharkbomb Studios, Martin Nerurkar, Konstantinos D.
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Ex Novo is a playable city-generator that helps you construct, and populate
  fictional villages, towns, and cities. This physical game can be played solo or
  with up to 3 friends. Playtime ranges from 1 to 3 hours.
  .
  Meet with your friends, and collaboratively draw the map of your city as you
  explore the history of its founding, and the forces, factions, and events that
  shape its development.
  .
  Ex Novo is both a fun game, and a tool that helps you build memorable
  settlements ready for further creative use; the cities generated can for example
  be used in any sort of narrative endeavors or as settings for pen and paper
  role-playing game adventures.
  .
  Please share your cities with us using the hashtag #ExNovoCity.
  .
  Created by Martin Nerurkar and Konstantinos Dimopoulos.
  .
  Playing Ex Novo
  .
  You (and up to three friends) take on the role of the guardian spirit of a
  freshly founded settlement. Its founding, in fact, conjured you into existence,
  and imbued you with purpose: to witness the settlement grow, shepherd its
  development, inspire its factions, and remember its stories.
  .
  During play you will make sense of the events happening as you roll dice, plan
  and draw on a collaborative map of your settlement, and influence its changing
  shape. You will flesh out a living place complete with landmarks, districts,
  resources, and people, and in the end create your own, unique, fictional town. A
  town with a true sense of history and place.
  .
  Sequence of Play
  .
  Play begins with a brief discussion phase, where each player shares their
  assumptions and expectations. The age and size of the city-to-be are also
  determined, and with them the expected duration of the game.
  .
  Next up is the founding phase. Taking turns, players define such fundamentals
  features of the settlement as the surrounding terrain or its original founding
  purpose. Every feature is described by the acting player, who will then have to
  draw it on the map. Following Ex Novo's initial sequence of turns, players will
  have an interesting starting situation in their hands.
  .
  The following phase, the development phase, is the core of the game. Each turn
  in this phase provides with an event brought forth  by the roll of three dice.
  These events need to be interpreted, and sketched by the active player. During
  the development phase the settlement will grow, change or even shrink; factions
  will rise and fall, populations will move, old neighborhoods will decline, and
  mighty edifices will be built. This is where the exciting history of your city
  will be played out, where its structure will evolve, and where the game map will
  get both bigger and richer.
  .
  The final phase is the topping out phase. These few quick turns are all that's
  needed to wrap up the development of the city, and tie up any loose ends.
  Dominant landmarks might even get named as your settlement's finishing touches

  .
  The MONOLITH EDITION is here.
  .
  The Monolith Edition features an entirely new layout, revised and edited text,
  and mechanical tweaks to the classic Extracausal experience.
  .
  The Monolith Edition adds new layers to the game and new tools to help spark
  more stories.
  .
  Aspects give depth and narrative impact to NPCs.
  .
  Cores provide extra moods and aesthetics for locations, as well as prompting new
  complications and consequences.
  .
  Forces are a vehicle of the extracausal. They push the narrative down winding
  paths and challenge the characters to make tough choices.
  .
  The Monolith Edition also introduces Sets - packages of new character and story
  options for tables that want to start with some more concrete inspiration.
  .
  The Monolith Edition adds more introductory material to help orient tables and
  players who might be new to tabletop role-playing games, as well as more
  examples of play that highlight the major elements of the game.
  .
  REVELATION AND DARKNESS
  .
  This is Extracausal; a role-playing game about creating and uncovering a dense
  web of the paranatural, the occult, conspiracies, and of things far beyond it
  all. This is a game of encountering that which is extracausal. Imagine the
  Magnus Institute, the Federal Bureau of Control, Southern Reach. All groups that
  are involved with forces far greater than they could ever imagine, filled with
  individuals who piece together clues and secrets in the hopes of knowing the
  unknowable.
  .
  Extracausal features an easy to pick up dice engine, and simple character and
  world creation. Play as characters in far over their head as they race to
  uncover the truths about the strange, vast, dangerous, unknown forces of the
  extracausal. Create secrets and narrative elements that you later change, warp,
  shift, to form an emergent narrative web. Embrace twists and sudden reveals as
  you link together disparate elements into a larger, sprawling story.
  .
  Will you reach a shaking revelation? Or will reality be eclipsed by strange
  darkness? Play to find out.
  .
  All you need to play is a handful of six-sided dice, a few ten-sided dice,
  something to keep notes with, and a handful of friends.

  CONTEXT
  .
  The year is 2221 and you are the lone technician aboard the Eye of Ra, an anti-
  asteroid space station orbiting Earth.
  .
  It has been two decades since the Apep event caused widespread disturbances
  throughout the Solar System. Ancient orbital paths and gravitational
  partnerships were forever altered, and our centuries-old knowledge of them was
  rendered unreliable. The calculated, near-zero risk of an asteroid impact on an
  inhabited world suddenly became unknown.
  .
  The Solar Union scrambled to recalculate the odds, to find lost objects before
  they could strike one of its five member worlds. Nuclear warheads were
  stockpiled and aimed at the skies of the Incorporated Planet of Mercury, the
  Republic of Mars, the Federation of Jupiter, and the Colonial Republic of Titan.
  Meanwhile, on Earth, they built something entirely new: the Ra laser. An
  orbital, Solar-powered cannon capable of reaching across the Solar System and
  removing kilometres-wide objects from existence.
  .
  The power within the Eye of Ra defends us all from the modern asteroid threat.
  The Solar Union entrusts Earth with the protection of its member worlds, who in
  turn entrusts the Eye of Ra to one technician: you.

description:
  Fake Illusions is a collection of optical illusions-but some of them are not
  playing fair! Where some lines only look diagonal, one line actually is, and
  circles look like they differ in size, but secretly, one of them is bigger or
  smaller, camouflaged by the illusion. It's your job to point them out! But
  beware-the fakers will do everything to stay unnoticed... It's the ultimate test
  of your focus!
  .
  Featuring more than fifteen illusions about color, perspective, and movement,
  with lots of variants and distractions. Try the relaxing Zen mode, or the hectic
  Shuffle mode! Oh, and you can record GIFs, too!
  .
  Epilepsy warning

  This game features optical illusions, repeating patterns, and high contrast
  images. If you start feeling sick or dizzy while playing, stop immediately.

  brightness. Illusions that require you to spot differences in color can be
  skipped.
  .
  Textless: Very little reading is required to play Fake Illusions.
  .
  Autosave: Quit the game at any time and continue exactly where you left off next
  time you play.
  .
  Difficulty: You can freely adjust how much the faker stands out for every
  illusion.
  .
  Controls: Completely playable with just the mouse, keyboard, or gamepad.
  Keyboard and gamepad are remappable.

  THE GAME
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus is a first person exploration game set in a science fiction
  future. You are a crew member of the USSC Lazarus waking up from cryo sleep
  without memories and even without name in an apparently abandoned drifting cargo
  spaceship. But you're not alone, there is also Hybris, the Artificial
  intelligence who commands the ship.
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus is a deeply narrative video game. You will have to solve
  some puzzles and explore in order to advance in the story. The universe and
  story will unveil branching along the scenary, objects and documents left behind
  by the people who lived in the Lazarus at some point.
  .
  In addition if you search and connect the dots maybe a greater puzzle will be
  revealed and the darker truth around you will become brighter.
  .
  GAMEPLAY
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus is a first person exploration game. There is a main story
  you'll play but you'll have to search and inspect every detail of the scenary
  looking for clues, notes, letters and objects and piece by piece gather
  information about what's happening around you.
  .
  There are a lot of mysteries aboard the USSC Lazarus and depends on you how many
  of them you can resolve along your journey. At the end of it maybe you resolve
  the bigger puzzle around what's going on. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're
  wrong. You'll need to have in mind every detail in order to unveil the whole
  story.
  .
  You'll have to resolve some puzzles as well, but we wanted to integrate them in
  the narrative and the scenery. You are in a spaceship and we wanted it to feel
  like it. The interaction with these puzzles is the same as in the rest of the
  game trying to not break the immersion in the story.
  .
  And you'll also can interact with the terminals and computers around the ship.
  Some will give you key information, others will help you in your way out. There
  is a whole operating system full of software and apps filled with information of
  any kind to explore and take advantage of. You'll have a tool (called
  Mnem/0z1n3) that will help you gathering and classifying information and
  breaking through password protected terminals.

  PROLOGUE DEMO
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus: The First Passenger is the conclusive prologue and demo of
  The Fall of Lazarus. In this little adventure set in the year 2180 you will play
  as Caleb Rogers, a Gen-Ethics (an audit firm focused on controlling the
  normative and quality of criogenic, clonation and genetic alteration processes)
  who wakes up in the USSC Lazarus against his will.The First Passenger is a
  little slice of the final game where we showcase all the playable mechanics of
  the full game and also works as an example of the narrative we want to play
  with. You can play a whole level of the USSC Lazarus out of the five levels will
  include the final game, every one of them highly detailed and full of objects
  and terminal to interact with while playing the main story. But we wanted you to
  enjoy this little stand alone experience separately if you want to. This is only
  the prologue with another protagonist but we highly recommend you to stay tuned
  and, when the day comes, enjoy the full experience.
  .
  REFERENCES
  .
  When we have to describe The Fall of Lazarus in a phrase we always say it's like
  Firewatch (Campo Santo) meets the film Moon (Duncan Jones).
  .
  The astonishing off-frame and foreshadowing narrative of Moon is our core
  narrative reference and the slow paced development of the plot and clever
  dialogues of Firewatch are really inspiring to us.
  .
  Of course we're filled with references such us Gone Home, Mind: Path to
  Thalamus, The Guest and films like 2001: a space odyssey or Alien. Even Lost
  series are being really influencing because of how it works the mysteries and
  characters.
  .
  PLATFORMS
  .
  We will launch The Fall of Lazarus on PC at first. We obviously want to release
  it on as much platforms as we can, but right now we have to focus on the PC
  version. We also like to port the game to VR but we have to wait to see how
  things work.

  .
  THE WORLD OF SHADOWS
  .
  This place has very little to do with the world as we know it. Vampires
  Werewolves, Specters, and Demons are all real. The world is dark, twisted,
  brutal, and gothic. There are schemes and secrets everywhere. The true powers
  are those that thrive in the shadows. Surviving is an art and not at all
  guaranteed, even for Vampires.
  .
  The only reason humanity lived this far is numbers. The Vampires try to hide
  their existence from the world as to not draw undue attention. Attention gets
  you killed. Hence a council was established a long time ago to uphold the
  carnival, the thin layer of deception, and secrets that keep the vampires safe.
  Only some of the many vampire lineages submit to the authority of this council:
  The Beautiful, The Grotesque, The Highborn, The Mad, The Sorcerers, The Untamed,
  and the Warriors. The rest claim independence. But even they can appreciate the
  usefulness of the carnival from time to time.
  .
  It is best to keep your head down and not be noticed, but when did that ever
  work for long? Journey into an abyss of the afterlife, un-death, and blood.
  .
  This game is a homage to a certain other game of Vampires and I hope you enjoy
  the darkness within. It is a complete game and contains everything you need to
  play beside some friends, pen, paper, and dice.
  .
  Compared to core minimald6, Fangs adds a "Coterie" for the player characters,
  the group itself has traits that could be used for or against them. There are of
  course also rules about the monster inside, powers, and the use of blood.
  Everything a fledgling vampire needs to grow.
  .
  Play a Vampire from one of the 12 different lineages including The Assassins,
  The Grotesque, The Mad, The Untamed, and others.
  .
  Each lineage has unique traits and access to powerful, blood fueled gifts.
  .
  A small adventure generator to jumpstart your imagination and character sheets
  are included so you can start to play in minutes!

  Graphic design and layout by Vee Hendro (https://veerpgdesigns.com/)

  Far From Home is a game about immigrants and outsiders. It's about exploring
  what it means to live and thrive in a culture that is not fully your own. It's
  about how you piece together an identity drawing from multiple cultures, yet
  never wholly belonging to either.
  .
  You will create Characters and define who they are in the beginning, how they
  see themselves in relation to their Home and to the Hegemony they now live in.
  .
  As you create your Characters, you will also create a Circle that ties your
  Characters together. The Circle provides a context for your Characters to work
  together and support each other, and it also provides something different that
  each of your Characters want or need.
  .
  You will then play to see how your characters struggle and change as their Home
  and the Hegemony struggle and change with them.

description:
  The Festival of Deep Winter is storytelling game about collaboratively creating
  a winter festival, and exploring it through shared vignettes. This is a GM-less
  game for 2 to 6 people, and plays in about 45 minutes.
  .
  Celebrations grow out of culture and community. In The Festival of Deep Winter,
  you create those cultural keystones and watch a festival emerge from it. Your
  festival may be grounded in reality - it could be the kind of festival you might
  find in our world. Or your festival may be full of the fantastic and have a home
  in a world completely unlike our own.
  .
  Whatever your festival, may it bring you closer to the people at your table.
  .
  ---
  .
  The Festival of Deep Winter comes at the coldest time of year when the nights
  are long and the snow piled high. We come together to share warmth and
  connection. When winter bears down on us, we have friends and family to keep us
  warm.

genre: Strategy
description:
  Feud is a turn-based strategy game made by some guys you haven't heard of yet.
  Originally a board game designed by Dave Cordell, it's been polished and tweaked
  and generally mucked about with to bring it to the glowing screen you're reading
  this description on. Unless you printed it out? Think of the trees. Please.
  .
  Condensed abstract strategy!
  .
  Imagine chess, but on a four-by-four grid, where pieces are swapped rather than
  moved, each piece has its own special ability and--
  .
  OK, not so much like chess. What you can expect is a highly condensed little
  abstract strategy game which is easy enough to learn but quite tricky to get
  good at. The AI still beats us sometimes. The computers are winning. Please get
  good at Feud so we can beat them.
  .
  Cross-platform!
  .
  Feud has full cross-platform play between PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. This
  means you can play Feud at your boring job, then on the bus on the way home from
  your boring job, then on your computer at home while you recover from your
  boring job.
  .
  Please note that we do not recommend playing Feud during your commute if you
  walk to work, especially if you live in a city with lots of open manhole covers
  which is pretty much what I imagine New York to be like. I dunno, I've never
  been.
  .
  You haven't told me much about this game yet, to be honest!
  .
  I'm not very good at this. Sorry. Anyway, look, the game's pay-whatever and only
  a couple of hundred megabytes. You might as well, really.

  .
  Here we are! Grand Rapid Falls! The last race of an exhausting season of the
  Tour! The crazy, fast and dangerous races of recent months have been exciting to
  follow, but this race is the most beautiful, the most prestigious. Whoever wins
  it will be crowned Tour Champion!
  .
  This season, the Champion crushed the competition and won all the events. But
  her challengers all want to take her place in this final stage!
  .
  3.2.1. Let's go! The race is on! But don't forget that these drivers have had
  some great moments all season long (relive them on our dedicated channel!) and
  the final victory may not be the goal of all of them! The sidelines of the
  track, failures and successes, their relationships with other runners will
  impact their performance.
  .
  Will the Champion win the race? What impression will these Pilots leave? Who
  will we see again on the Tour? Who won't finish the race? All these answers (and
  more) in our live stream!
  .
  Final Lap is a role-playing game for 2 or more players (although it is possible
  to play it alone). Based on Alex Roberts' game For the Queen, and therefore
  Descended from the Queen, it takes the form of a deck of cards, which we'll draw
  as the game progresses. They'll help us create our story.
  .
  The game exists in the form of a 24-pages booklet in pdf. You'll need a 52-card
  deck (or 54 with the jokers). Nothing else except your imagination is required.
  A game lasts between 30 minutes and 2h30, depending on the number of cards
  you're exploring. You decide when the game stops.
  .
  Final Lap explores the world of racing. We play as drivers in the last race of
  the season. The race that will determine the winner of the season. The Champion
  has won everything this season and is the favorite. But we are her challengers
  and we have an opportunity to beat her in this final lap.
  .
  During the game, we'll tell live scenes from the race itself as we approach the
  final lap. But we will also tell flashbacks about our past and what happened in
  previous races, between races or even before we entered the Tour. We will
  explore our relationships with each other and with the Champion.
  .
  Final Lap is available in a light version on the For The Drama platform. You
  will be able to play it online with a single ending where the Champion wins for
  sure. You can also use the platform to discover the game's questions and quickly
  test a game.
  .
  The full game includes 13 game settings with different atmospheres:
  .
  Fast & Furious style street racing
  .
  Aviator races in the heart of gigantic metropolises
  .
  Soapbox races
  .
  But also magician races, post-apocalyptic rallies, bike races ...
  .
  13 original champions are also available. All illustrated by Jan Van Houten,
  they allow you to quickly sketch the features of this secondary character in the
  race. Each Champion is associated with a Setting, but feel free to swap them
  around. Or use these Champions to define your own characters.
  .
  The race is just an excuse. Go for it. Have crazy adventures. Take on your
  opponents on the track. Find out who you are and why you're running these
  races...

description:
  The experience of waiting is universal and in many senses a uniquely human one.
  When adventure is promised and withheld, what becomes of the would-be hero? When
  their only companion is endless time and one another, what becomes of the noble
  adventuring party or crew of scoundrels? In a world of heroic adversity, how
  does a hero deal with the absurdity of being stuck in a small and hostile space?
  .
  Enter the Finest: the worst establishment in the world. There will be no music,
  drinks or friendly strangers; there may be fights, but they will only make your
  stay here more miserable. Worst of all, there is no exit. This is limbo, and
  you're in it for the long haul. Perhaps you'll come out friends on the other
  side. Maybe you'll even learn something about yourself in the Finest's exquisite
  desolation.
  .
  In short, have you ever wanted to replicate the experience of No Exit or Waiting
  for Godot as a prelude to your adventure? Have you ever wanted to define the
  space before the adventure begins? Are you interested in taking perhaps the most
  humanizing act of characterization possible, having to wait with no other
  recourse? Maybe you think you'd enjoy a game about being strictly confined and
  essentially disempowered. All of these, it turns out, can be surprisingly fun.

  In the Firebringer are two self-contained adventures around The Garden of the
  Spire Queen.
  .
  The Missing Historian is an investigative adventure around a missing scholar,
  Edmund Winterholme, who was personally tasked by the Spire Queen finding clues
  about a powerful weapon. It contains a chart with the characters relations
  between each other, a chart where to find clues and what actions take place
  while the players investigate the case.
  .
  The main adventure though is The Temple of the Blazing Sun. This adventure
  starts with the information gathered by the historian. The players travel to
  another hex and find the hidden entrance to the long forgotten temple. There
  they'll find a riddle regarding the Firebringer to get to the shrine in the
  middle of the temple and the old artefact. Inside the temple they are confronted
  with the long dead, but also a new inhabitant.

game: Fist - Ultra Edition (USA)

developer: CLAYMORE
publisher: CLAYMORE
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Now: the second half of the twentieth century. The powers that be are locked in
  a tense nuclear standoff, and the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Away
  from the watchful eye of national intelligence, a cadre of exceptional misfits
  is assembled. These soldiers of fortune are uniquely equipped for covert and
  unusual operations.
  .
  In these uncertain times, the line between science and superstition has been
  broken, and the new arms race is only beginning. You, or your associates, may be
  faced with weapons, tactics, and actors unlike any you have ever seen. For a
  price, those exceptional misfits can help.
  .
  When you're all out of options, it's time to call FIST.
  .
  FIST: Ultra Edition is a tabletop roleplaying game about paranormal mercenaries
  doing the tough jobs no one else can. In the game, you belong to a legendary
  rogue mercenary unit called FIST. You are a soldier of fortune who doesn't fit
  into modern society. You are a disposable gun for hire, caught up in the death
  and destruction of pointless proxy wars and oppressive establishments. You may
  also be someone who can turn into a ghost or control bees with your mind.
  .
  The paranormal secrets of the Cold War are your bread and butter, and you fight
  for your life to make ends meet alongside others like you: stopping disastrous
  science experiments, infiltrating occult compounds, neutralizing eldritch
  horrors-all in a day's work for FIST. Players are typically outnumbered, easily
  killed, and disliked or hunted by most sources of authority. You don't have tons
  of money and gadgets backing you up, just your wits and a few tools. War is
  hell, and you're one of the little guys.
  .
  FIST is inspired by Metal Gear Solid, The A-Team, and Doom Patrol. It's
  mechanically descended from John Harper's World of Dungeons, Ben Milton's Maze
  Rats, and Offworlders, by Chris P. Wolf and Olivia Gulin.
  .
  PARANORMAL MERCENARIES: Use the modular traits system to construct unique and
  fully-equipped characters in seconds. Play as a telekinetic alien, a mutant
  sniper, or a cyborg ninja.
  .
  BRUTAL ACTION: Experience fast, fluid stunts and combat with partial successes.
  Play with a simple, dynamic system which deepens organically as characters
  advance, offering intriguing choices and mechanics but never interfering with
  the action.
  .
  TACTICAL OPERATIONS: Plan and execute Cold War espionage missions using enemy,
  weapon, and mod templates in tandem with the Intelligence Matrix, a massive
  repository of random tables, inspirational tools, and premade content. Structure
  campaigns around a levelling system which uses open-ended character development
  in place of XP and loot, and customize your game with a wide array of optional
  mechanics.
  .
  ULTRA EDITION: Create stranger and more powerful mercs than ever before with
  23,220 possible starting character builds. With revised content from FIST
  Classic plus 116 brand new traits (and 36 character roles!) portray bullet-time
  wizards, cannibalistic weaponsmiths, and astronaut werewolves. Enjoy the final
  form of FIST, a genre-blending melange of old- and new-school design.
  .
  "FIST is legitimately one of the most fun things I've brought to my table. It's
  PbtA that plays like OSR, and it's Metal Gear by way of Hellboy."
  .
  - Richard Kelly, Sprinting Owl
  .
  "FIST is such a thrill ride. The sheer depth of possible characters, the joy of
  the random results, the added chaos the WAR DICE add into the mix. It's nothing
  less than explosive."
  .
  - Jeff Stormer, Party of One
  .
  "FIST is a game of minimum prep and maximum action. Every character feels unique
  after just a few minutes of setup, and every session creates a story that's
  never been told before. This game knows exactly how to get your players excited,
  your characters emotional, and your loadout ready to rock and roll."
  .
  - Caleb Zane Huett, lead designer of Triangle Agency
  .
  "FIST has changed the way I look at RPGs. With FIST, you can sit down, roll some
  dice, and have a fun, flavorful character in five minutes flat. You might get
  them killed five minutes later, but if so? Rinse, repeat, and you're back in the
  game. Add in the clever mechanics for freeform tactical play, a GM toolkit with
  enough tables to seat an army, and prose so evocative that it's a joy just to
  read the book, and this is a must-have game."
  .
  - Jess Levine, I Have the High Ground, going rogue 2e
  .
  "I have transported people to the moon through ancient temples, I have fought
  off armies of alien bugs using mashed potatoes, I have laid down suppressing
  fire on  Russian soldiers while my teammate defused a bomb. FIST is a marvel of
  modern design that pushes its core mechanics into bold new places (sometimes at
  gunpoint). It's a blast to run, and a thrill to play."
  .
  - Tony from Plus One
  .
  "FIST is as enjoyable to read as it is to play, with immersive text and a splash
  of a casual banter vibe that sets the mood as you learn, and puts you just in
  the right headspace to play a rogue little outcast."
  .
  - Superdillin
  .
  FIST is easy to hack and built for creative homebrewing. You can check out a
  library of 150+ (and growing!) FIST-compatible zines, pamphlets, modules, and
  more made by fans of the game right here.

description:
  A STORY ABOUT DIMENSIONS, SHAPES AND JEWELS
  .
  According to the Flat Kingdom's legends, the world was once filled with malice
  and chaos because the 3D realm dominated all. But one day, a wise sorcerer
  created six Magical Jewels that kept the effects of the third dimension at bay,
  granting peace and prosperity to the beautiful 2D world.
  .
  However, one day an evil masked thief named Hex stole one of those Jewels and
  kidnapped the princess. This disrupted the balance and made the chaos return.
  .
  The king of Flat Kingdom knew there was only one being able to save their land:
  Flat, the little shapeshifting hero! With his unique abilities, he's not only
  able to change his shape, but is also the only one in the kingdom capable of
  withstanding the 3D chaos.
  .
  Now the time has come. Flat must use his incredible powers to save the world and
  restore the Flat Kingdom to its former glory. Will he be able to stop Hex before
  it's too late?
  .
  GAMEPLAY
  .
  Flat Kingdom is filled with fun platforming action, puzzles and some
  Metroidvania elements. It also features a unique combat system! Instead of
  directly attacking your foes, you'll have to touch them while transformed in the
  correct shape to beat them! Kinda like a rock-paper-scissor game.
  .
  Every shape in Flat Kingdom beats the opposite, so sharp triangles can defeat
  the soft circles, heavy squares beat the fragile triangles and squishy circles
  can triumph over the slow squares. Both enemies and puzzles can be beaten using
  the correct shape and strategy, so you'll have to observe them and come up with
  the best solution.
  .
  You can also learn new abilities along the way that will help you solve even
  more puzzles, beat enemies faster and reach new areas that were inaccessible to
  you before!
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Jump into a beautiful papercraft world, filled with details and references to
  classic games.
  .
  Test your might with epic and challenging battles against giant bosses.
  .
  Uncover all of the game's secrets! There are side quests, upgrades and all kinds
  of surprises.
  .
  Learn all about the kingdom's lore and history by finding hidden scrolls.

  .
  Earth, 20XX
  .
  It started in the late year 200X. Ghosts, demons, and other occult forces grew
  resistant to conventional exorcisms. Minor possessions, the kind that would
  previously have been resolved with a sprinkle of holy water and a few minutes of
  half-hearted praying, suddenly became multiple-hour-long, life-or-death ordeals.
  .
  Major possessions swallowed entire townships and broke holy men.
  .
  Worse, the unspoken rule that a possessing force had to operate only through the
  local environment became snapped and frayed.
  .
  Possessors could now manifest physically, and they were extremely swole.
  .
  Thus, the world entered a new age of banishments. Gone were the days when any
  reedy man could cast out a demon.
  .
  Fighting the supernatural was now a job for...
  .
  The Flexorcists.
  .

  ------------------
  .
  The Flexorcists is a 23 page tabletop rpg about pro-wrestlers working a side-gig
  where they banish ghosts, stake draculas, and powerbomb creatures from lagoons.

developer: Mars Ashton
publisher: Mars Ashton
genre: Interactive Fiction;Rhythm
description:
  FLUX presents a variety of limited-difficulty experiences: Interactive fiction
  with a series of mini-games that challenge you to type, hack-n-slash, organize
  or fidget to earn credits and purchase numerous cosmetic items: hairstyles,
  helmets, outfits and upgrades! Designed to allow players to alternate between
  chill and twitch-based game modes, the game provides players with a number of
  activities to engage with that offer zero consequences. Flux and chill!
  .
  Wanderer, a blue-haired ex-military swordsman, spends their nights joy
  riding/flying through the streets/skies of a sprawling cyberpunk cityscape.
  Through conversations with Wanderer's girlfriend and local NPCs you'll learn
  more about the world and reveal many answers to mysteries surrounding those that
  live there.
  .
  Many Minigames in One: Fiction, Beat-em-up, Typing, Fidget, Rhythm, Reflective
  activities are available as "jobs" you can take each day, each with their own
  objectives and pace!
  .
  Cosmetics + Cybernetics: Earn credits throughout your experience and spend them
  on new outfits, helmets, hairstyles and augments for your body.
  .
  Customizable and Chill Tunes: Listen to the 80s Chillwave groove provided by
  Quantum Dylan or replace the provided .mp3 files in the install directory and
  create your own soundscape!
  .
  Compelling World: Text your girlfriend, listen to the news, interact with your
  environment and converse with locals to learn more about the game's characters
  and world.
  .
  Built in Flash: Yeah, THAT Flash, which means the file size is small and loading
  times are nonexistent!
  .
  Flux's game modes are treated as "jobs" each day. By participating in one, you
  shift the game forward in time. Each mode has a Flux value representing the
  game's music volume and speed rate that rise and fall depending on the mode's
  mechanics:
  .
  Groove: A traditional rhythm activity tasking players with pressing the correct
  inputs at
  .
  Freestyle: A fidget style game where you define your own rhythm, reflect and
  zone out to the beat.
  .
  Challenge: A typing-oriented game where you are given random letters A-Z to
  press. This tests your awareness of each letter's position on the keyboard.
  .
  Spelling: A typing-oriented mode where you are tasked with spelling out entire
  words to increase your Flux.
  .
  Glyph: A visual challenge where you must rotate the objects on the right with
  the arrow keys to match the positions of the objects on the left.
  .
  Rash+Slash: An action-oriented mode that pits you against incoming enemy robots.
  Use your trusty katana to cut your way through the enemy!
  .
  Assault: A beat-em-up mode that throws you into the heat of battle, challening
  players to survive a gauntlet of robots and enemy soldiers that are armed to the
  helmet with special attacks, a variety of weapons and keep on coming in waves.
  .
  Mecha: Like Freestyle, but in the open skies above the city. Reflect, find your
  groove and enjoy the view.
  .
  Armament: An action-oriented mode that has you defending the skies with your
  Mech airship. Take out the incoming robots with your blasters!
  .
  In order to add your own music you must have the following: an mp3 format music
  file, the file renamed to "track1", "track2", "track3", "track4" or "track5",
  and finally the file must be added to the game's included Music folder. Once the
  game is run it'll automatically load up these tracks sequentially as you begin
  to cruise. If you want to play another song, simply stop cruising and begin
  again to "skip" that track!
  .
  If you enjoy the music as much as I do,give Quantum Dylan a listen!

developer: Narrative Dynamics
publisher: Narrative Dynamics
genre: Role Playing
description:
  FONT is a story game for 2 to 4 players. Each session is a stand-alone story,
  unfolding over 1 to 3 hours. Players take on the role of travelers to a perilous
  landscape called the FISSURE. These travelers seek a powerful place called the
  FONT, which can change their dying world. The characters in each game of FONT
  may be wildly different, but they are always driven by a shared purpose: a hope
  that their world could be saved.
  .
  FONT is a highly collaborative, GM-less game. It requires no prep, and the
  concise ruleset is easy to learn on the fly. During a session, players take
  turns introducing tests that the group encounters in the FISSURE. Another player
  then describes what must be done to overcome the test. This shared authorship
  over the dramatic beats prompts players to collaborate on the tone and pace of
  play, leading to a level of detail that makes the FISSURE feel more alive.
  .
  FONT focuses strongly on the inner life of characters and ties character
  development closely to the resolution system. Over the course of a session,
  characters are changed by the FISSURE, gaining marks that they carry with them.
  These marks may eventually end a character's journey, as they abandon their
  quest or even die. Players can take respite from the journey to remove each
  other's marks, creating moments of shared solace in a harrowing journey.
  .
  FONT's arc is inspired by other fictional forays into strange landscapes,
  notably Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker and Jeff VanderMeer's Annihilation.

  FOR THE HONOR HAS BEEN KICKSTARTED! NEW VERSION SOON! CLICK HERE TO CHECK IT
  OUT!
  .
  Rathael is a land full of magical people, fantastical creatures, and mystical
  kingdoms. It is studded with ancient ruins left behind by a long-lost
  civilization.
  .
  It had always been a peaceful realm.
  .
  That is, until twelve years ago. The Legion came down from the stars and began
  to colonize the planet. Their expansion was swift and brutal. Caught on the back
  foot, the kingdoms of Rathael united and forged the Rathaelian Resistance. The
  warriors and princepts of the Resistance fought valiantly.
  .
  Within a year they pressed the Legion back to their stronghold. Sadly, their
  final assault ended in tragedy. The Resistance shattered and the Kingdoms turned
  to isolation.
  .
  It has been twelve years, and a new generation is beginning to see the need for
  another Resistance. The Legion has been attacking towns again. The Kingdoms are
  sending out invitations to balls. And the Wilds have been getting stranger and
  stranger.
  .
  You, the princepts and warriors of factions at odds, will clash, quarrel, and
  flirt to sway Rathael in your favor.
  .
  For The Honor is an anthology game inspired by She-ra and the Princesses of
  Power. It's based on the Firebrands Framework by Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.
  .
  For The Honor is comprised of 12 mini-games: The Prelude, Venture Forth,
  Crossing Paths, Mincing Words, Taking the Dance Floor, Hand to Heart, Taking
  Shape, Giving Chase, Blade to Stave, Search and Rescue, All-Out Battle, and
  Stand United.
  .
  3-6 players. 2-5 hours per session.
  .
  You can listen to Quinn discuss and play For The Honor on the She-Ra:
  Progressive of Power podcast here: https://simplecast.com/s/4d1977f8
  .
  This game is nearly complete. The current version is 1.0! The layout is
  currently in progress so for now the game is here pre-layout but fully playable!
  .
  Buying the game now will get you the final version when it is released.  For
  updates follow @Mx_quinn and @forthehonorrpg on twitter.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  For the Dungeon! is a comedy role-playing game where you get to play as the
  hapless minions instead of the heroes. Experience the rush of unquestioning
  loyalty to a darker power and charging into danger with reckless abandon! Raid
  villages, scout ancient ruins for artifacts, and protect the dungeon from
  homicidal adventurers.
  .
  Instead of a well established world, the game uses principles taken from Powered
  by the Apocalypse style games and improv comedy to create the setting. For the
  Dungeon! relies heavily on player created prompts that are interpreted by the
  Game Master to reveal the details of the world.
  .
  The game is designed to be fast-paced, with a focus on creating memorable
  moments. Because the game is light and has a greater focus on the story, anybody
  can pick up and play with minimal effort. The fun is created more through the
  unexpected scenarios the players get themselves into than by studying rules.
  .
  So how do you play? Characters are represented by a set of short descriptions
  called traits. They cover a character's skills, equipment, and motivations.
  Traits provide an easy way to know both who your character is and what they're
  good at.
  .
  Something inherent to being a minion is their penchant for chaos. Critical
  failures are a core part of what makes the game unique and fun. Whenever the
  characters critically fail the player provides a prompt that the Game Master
  uses as inspiration for whatever hilariously unexpected misfortune befalls them.
  .
  With failure comes experience. When a minion rolls a critical failure they write
  down what they learned from the experience instead of tracking experience
  points. These experiences can be used just like traits, but only as long as you
  continue to succeed.
  .
  In addition to playing as a minion, all players get to influence what is going
  on in the dungeon. During downtime, players choose from a handful of dungeon
  actions that alter the world to naturally create interesting story hooks to
  pursue.

  A low-poly walking simulator that puts you into a desolate, fully-greyscale
  forest that is devoid of life. While moving through this world, you must destroy
  blinking, disruptive roots that are burdening your path and the space around
  you. Sometimes these roots spawn new life, and sometimes a human, Charlie,
  appears. As you play through, the world will gradually saturate and life will
  begin to populate around you.
  .
  Charlie has a story to tell and it is your choice about if you want to follow
  and listen, or walk away and continue restoring the forest.
  .
  To play, use WASD to move through the space and click the left mouse button to
  swing your arm. You can move slightly faster by holding Shift.

  Forking Paths is my ongoing RPG zine spanning a variety of content. In this
  inaugural issue, a Guidebook to the Viridian Maw!
  .
  This 24-page PDF of the digest-sized zine contains fodder for a wilderness
  sandbox campaign in the Viridian Maw: an overgrown meteor crater, mutated and
  reshaped by fungal influence. To get a sense of it, check out the free download
  below for the one-page version of the setting.
  .
  Everything is system neutral & stats agnostic, though the material is written
  with genre assumptions leaning toward D&D/OSR games (but usable for games like
  Apocalypse World or Dungeon World, too).
  .
  26 wildlife entries including plants, animals, fungi & trees
  .
  14 interior illustrations
  .
  Overview of peoples living in the crater
  .
  Backstory for the ancient history of the Viridian Maw
  .
  Advice and tips on using the material
  .
  Random tables to generate interesting ruins & encounters
  .

  Forking Paths is my ongoing RPG zine spanning a variety of content. The theme
  for this second issue: Lost in Dark Halls.
  .
  The core of this zine is Labyrinthine, a self-contained storygame inspired by
  Greek myth, for solo or group play. Using prompts on maze tiles, you'll tell the
  story of a protagonist worthy of myth as they make choices and handle
  consequences. You won't explore just one series of events from beginning to end,
  though: you'll traverse many branches, returning to earlier decisions to make
  new choices and see how events play out from there. Labyrinthine supports one to
  four players, with a game length of one to three hours.
  .
  52 maze tiles with unique prompts, falling into 6 types based on layout:
  Crosses, Branches, Halls, Turns, Ends, and Shrines
  .
  Alternate method of play using a deck of playing cards, using the keyed prompts
  .
  Card-based oracle for quickly generating protagonists (also available in handy
  digital form)
  .
  Overview of the classical myth of the Labyrinth, Minotaur, Theseus, and Ariadne
  (and exploration of the myth's conflicting accounts)
  .
  Separate download of maze tile PDF ready for DIY printing
  .
  The zine's cover and the bundled PDF of print-at-home maze tiles are in color;
  all other art and illustrations are in B&W. The PDF is in single-page layout
  format. Need it another way? Let me know!
  .
  I've also uploaded a PDF of blank maze tiles as a free download for anyone
  wanting to customize the existing set of tiles, or make their own set! There's a
  French version of the game rules & maze tiles as well, generously translated by
  Emojk.

  Forking Paths is my ongoing RPG zine spanning a variety of analog game ideas.
  The theme for issue three: Out from the Shadows.
  .
  The game spread throughout this issue is New Forms, an eerie atmospheric chamber
  larp in the Nordic style, heavily inspired by the works of horror/weird
  fiction/philosophy writer Thomas Ligotti. Players assemble in a strange
  variation of a support group, using an apparatus of light and shadow to search
  for unusual "forms" hidden within mundane objects, recording and discussing
  their findings and what insights they reveal in relation to the group's ominous
  otherworldly beliefs.
  .
  New Forms is playable in two hours or less and is ideal for groups of 3 to 12
  players (number of players is the main factor governing the larp's runtime).
  .
  Contents of this 24-page zine:
  .
  Tone-setting short fiction piece "Ruins midnight Sunday all welcome"
  .
  12-page "in-character" pamphlet, covering the core larp activity & doubling as
  an optional in-game prop
  .
  Observation sheet for use during the Exhibition section of the larp (physically
  cut & pasted together using text from a typewriter, for that bureaucratic feel!)
  .
  4 illustrated examples of recorded observations from investigated relics
  .
  Additional game context, larp-running logistics, ideas for altering the game, &
  larp safety tools
  .
  Also included: separate PDF downloads of the New Forms pamphlet and observation
  sheet for DIY printing
  .
  The zine's cover pages are in color; all other art and illustrations are in B&W.
  The main PDF is in single-page layout format, and the New Forms pamphlet prop is
  already in booklet layout for easy home printing. Need any of it another way?

description:
  Fossil Echo is a short and challenging story driven platformer with hand drawn
  2D graphics. Set in a fantastical world, it tells a wordless tale of adventure
  and mystery.
  .
  Features
  .
  Varied and detailed environments
  .
  Hand animated 2D characters
  .
  Over 15 minutes of fully animated cutscenes
  .
  A wordless, mysterious story
  .
  Breathtaking orchestral score
  .
  Very dynamic and demanding platforming gameplay

  .
  Story
  .
  Influenced by the Oddworld series, Ico, and Shadow of the Collosus, as well as
  Studio Ghibli films, Fossil Echo tells the story of a young boy and his journey
  to climb a giant tower in the middle of the sea. How and why he got there are
  questions that will be answered via playable flashbacks during his ascent. The
  game offers over 15 minutes of fully animated cutscenes and the story is told
  without any dialogue or written text.
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  Fossil Echo mixes old-school, "die & retry" platforming gameplay with some
  stealth elements. As in Abe's Oddysee and Another World, you have little margin
  for error; precise movement and timing is required to get through and avoid
  confrontation, as the character is young, weak, and unable to fight or kill,
  most of the time...
  .
  Art
  .
  Fossil Echo features a detailed art style, with pre-rendered/hand painted
  backgrounds and hand animated 2D characters. Adopting the style of animated
  film, it presents an array diverse environments, from lush forest to snow
  covered tower. With no HUD or any indications displayed on screen, the game aims
  at immersing you from start to finish.
  .
  Sound
  .
  The world of Fossil Echo is brought to life by over two hours of unique,
  original music by John Robert Matz (Gunpoint, Rodina) and sound design by Gordon
  McGladdery (Rogue Legacy, Fantastic Contraption). Music and sound work in
  concert to set the mood and highlight the story and actions during gameplay and
  cutscenes.
  .
  Fossil Echo is developed by Phil Crifo (Story, Art & Design), Thierry Boura
  (Programming), John Robert Matz (Music), and A Shell In The Pit (Sound Design).

  The world has ended once before, and there are those who aim to end it again.
  The demon summoned to embark this second apocalypse is only a child, and a woman
  who has lost it all resolves to save her. A half-hour long narrative game with
  survival gameplay elements and two endings.
  .
  The year is 19XX. The world has been lost to a demon apocalypse, the remnants of
  this devastation staining the landscape and leaving mere dozens of people alive.
  The wastes are harsh, and camaraderie is hard to come by. You play as Del, a
  bruiser who patrols the wastes in her truck. She's hardened by this dead world,
  but something softer lies beneath her violent exterior.
  .
  Despite the destruction of it all, there are those in the end of the world who
  feel that perhaps the first time didn't quite take. On an average patrol, Del
  spots a pillar of fire in the distance and the source of it can only be one
  thing: demons have been summoned once more. But even demons can be innocent.
  Barrett is no more than a child, and those left in the world are either out to
  get her, or to control her.

  Four Horsemen is a visual novel / SLG about homelands and the immigrant
  experience. Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting
  in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves
  in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will
  you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents
  fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents' identity at any cost, at the
  price of being a permanent stranger in your home country? Or will you strike out
  on your own, turning against both your homelands to shape a destiny for
  yourself? Love is all you need...and also improvised firearms.
  .
  Drawing from the developers' own lived experiences, interviews with current and
  former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking
  anthropological research, featuring 4 different main storylines, 9 different
  endings, 12 different playable homelands (all of which play differently), and a
  multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen is the most
  heartwarmingly familiar, brutally honest video game about the immigrant
  experience ever created. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours,
  but you'll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the
  game has to tell...and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your
  own.
  .
  Exciting Bullet Points!!
  .
  YOUR DECISIONS MATTER. Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt
  you at the end. Characters turn out to be heroic or villainous depending on how
  you treat them--and they don't always reward you for treating them well.
  .
  NO TWO COUNTRIES PLAY ALIKE. Each homeland has its own unique vocabulary, set of
  cultural values, prejudices, and history. Choices that are a good idea in one
  country turn out to be a reaaaaally bad idea in another. Like a real immigrant,
  you'll have to read your new culture and learn to adapt.
  .
  NOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE. No faction reputation system! No alignment meter! Four
  Horsemen offers realistic, genuinely difficult moral choices, and to some
  questions there are no right answers--only different consequences.
  .
  DELIGHTFUL CRAFTING SYSTEM. Make that cold, austere war bunker feel like home--
  dive into dumpsters scrounging for parts, or buy them with your earnings from
  your terrible day job, and make reasonable DIY facsimiles of things you can't
  afford! Characters interact with things you build. Make a disco ball and they'll
  throw a dance party, patch up that hole in the roof and they'll enjoy a quiet
  moment together on a rainy day. But beware--the system is not exactly fair to
  immigrants...
  .
  TRIUMPH OVER HATE. A bigot pulls a knife on you--what do you do? Do you try to
  de-escalate the situation with words...or respond by drawing your own blade? Our
  combat system replicates the anxiety and tension of real violence, not a power
  fantasy.
  .

  Frankenmonster Creaturestein is a 36-page, fully illustrated table top RPG
  suitable for groups of for 4-6+ people (including the GM).

  Somewhere in 19th century Europe, a feckless Rogue Scientist has wrought havoc

  you to follow a series of Connections to prevent whatever terrible plans are in
  motion!

  Frankenmonster Creaturestein's mechanic revolves around your Body Parts, each of
  which corresponds to a particular Skill. The more Body Parts you have
  corresponding to a Skill, the better you are at it!
  .
  You'll create your Monsters using the surrealist artistic exercise of the
  Exquisite Corpse, and from there you can trade Body Parts with your comrade
  Monsters to optimise and strategise, lean more towards being a monstrosity or a
  human, and face off against terrible Adversaries!
  .
  To play the game you only need:
  .
  At least twelve six-sided dice.

  "The Ouija Board of Roleplaying Games" - Occult Victorian parlor games for those
  who love paranormal investigation and ghost stories.

  There is nothing quite like them. The Papers combine elements of live action
  roleplaying games, mass hypnosis as performed by stage magicians, the guided
  meditations of Tibetan monks, and seances of turn of the century spiritual
  mediums.
  .
  Each game promises an immersive night of supernatural exploration for you and
  group of friends, placing you at the center of a real life ghost story.
  .
  The games are each unique, guiding you through a series of seance-like
  paranormal investigations.
  .
  Each of the ten games is connected to the next, following the story of the
  mysterious Mr. Frost and his own experiments over a hundred years ago.
  .
  They let you follow his footsteps as carefully as you can to unveil clues about
  the strange realm called the Grey beyond the Fog and the Shadowman that stalks
  it.
  .
  There are no scripts, no actors, and no props. These games provide you the
  framework to have genuine frightening experiences heavy with occult and
  supernatural theme.
  .
  It's the closest thing to being in a supernatural horror movie you'll ever
  experience.

developer: Riverhouse Games
publisher: Riverhouse Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  The forest stands old. When the fog rolls in at dusk, and the boots of mailed
  adventurers crush stems and ferns, these trees uproot. Not quenched by rain or
  river, the forest drinks the blood of its invaders. This forest is old, full of
  memory, and anger.
  .
  You stand, within the core of ancient aspen or old oak, feeling the flow of sap
  in spring and the frozen silence of icy winter. As the forest breathes, you burn
  the bones of those who sought to carve through. Cruel dryads, all, you and your
  fellow spirits spire upwards toward the light of stars, and score the stone
  beneath your roots with deep cracking force.
  .
  And one day hatred walks in your domain. Fire and steel assails wood and stone
  as armored knights, gnarled wizards, and shrike sharp rogues bring death with
  them. Passing through wood like doors you emerge, recondite and wielding blades
  of razor thin fern. You defend the woods. And for now the intruders melt into
  the dirt and you sleep once again. If a hate-filled heart screams in the forest
  and no one is around to hear it, does it still make a sound?
  .
  Full of Memory And Anger is a meditation game of time and stillness, interrupted
  by brief scenes of ecological retribution. You play fae creatures living in the
  heartwood of old growth trees, dispensing asymmetrical retaliation to intruders
  in your realm. These intruders may bring with them evil and hate. They may be
  powerful fantasy adventurers, formidable masters of industry, or indiscriminate
  agents of chaos and pollution. You will always crush them in terrifying ways.
  .
  This game is inspired by The Skeletons by Bully Pulpit Games. It is a game of
  answering questions, but more importantly it is a game of silence and of
  waiting.

  WHAT THE F_CK IS THIS PLACE?
  .
  At the end of the before time the earth was scorched in deadly fire. Salt flats,
  craggy canyons, sand molten to glass, and vast stretches of desert is all that's
  around you. Like toys dropped from a giant child remnants from the past dot the
  landscape. A rusted tanker in the middle of nowhere, its hull is broken apart
  like a whale corpse burst open. Seats and debris from a giant plane are littered
  about for miles as if they were spat out. Craters where the bombs fell. Here and
  there old crumbling remains of structures, now repurposed as fortifications for
  the powerful. And very rarely, like blackened fingers clawing at the sky, the
  old towers billowing dark clouds that still produce the thing everyone wants,
  no, needs to survive. Gasoline. Most people have been driven insane by the
  parched and unforgiving landscape or the monstrous raiders by now. The gangs are
  the ones that have the wheels and the power. The strongest and most merciless
  lead. This is no time for weakness as the weak get eaten. Sometimes literally.
  There are only crazies left in one way or another. And this is a world you want
  to step into? Good luck!

  WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
  .
  At the end of the before-time, deadly fire scorched the earth. Salt flats,
  craggy canyons, sand molten to glass, and vast stretches of desert are all
  that's around you. Like toys dropped from a giant child, remnants from before
  dot the landscape. A rusted tanker in the middle of nowhere, its hull broke
  apart like a whale corpse burst open. Crumbling remains of structures, now
  repurposed as fortifications. And, like blackened fingers clawing at the sky,
  towers billowing dark clouds that still produce the thing everyone wants, no,
  needs to survive: Gasoline.
  .
  This one-page TTRPG uses the flexible Tricube Tales rules to tell stories about
  survivors on a ravaged earth after the apocalypse. Uses a simple d6 mechanic: If
  a player attempts something risky, they roll 1-3 six-sided dice and must equal
  or beat a difficulty of 4-6 on at least one die. There is some nuance and Karma
  to influence your dice, but that's the gist of it.
  .
  Strap in, drive, scavenge, steal, or barter for Stuff to survive. The wastes and
  the people that still live there are dangerous, and your only hope is to get out
  of this place to reach the verdant valley.

  About
  .
  On your way back home through the solar system, you will encounter countless
  lifeless obstacles which you must dodge. Using your small arsenal of galactic
  gardening tools, you can plant life onto these obstacles to calm them and grant
  you an easier path back home. Dodge everything, and Plant Trees!
  .
  Weapons
  .
  As your mission is to sprout as many trees throughout the galaxy as possible,
  your ship is equipped with the latest in galactic gardening technologies. You
  switch between:
  .
  (very) Berry Blaster
  .
  With this weapon you get the most seed output per second. As you upgrade the
  Berry Blaster, the more seeds you produce. At full upgrade you gain two gatling
  guns spraying seedlings at double the speed!
  .
  Copter' Cannon
  .
  The Copter' Cannon fires much slower than the Berry Blaster, but can plant on
  multiple targets and knocks affected targets away from the player. At full
  upgrade you gain to alternating cannons that fire the largest seed specimens in
  the galaxy at double speed!
  .
  Protect & Pollinate
  .
  With this weapon activated, your ship is surrounded with a protective aura that
  will pollinate any targets that get inside the field. It also slows the movement
  of all targets that enter the field, protecting the ship and giving you time to
  maneuver through the field of obstacles. Each upgrade to this weapon increases
  the pollination rate, and aura radius.

  Gambit: Suits is a rules lite battle resolver. The rules, set across 2 playing
  cards (with printable two-sided designs, so you can print it out and fold it so

  .
  Each Suit has a purpose: want to defend? Play a Spade. If your number is higher
  than someone playing, say, a Heart to melee attack - you win! No damage! If you
  lose? Take that amount of HP damage.
  .
  It really is that simple!
  .
  If you want something fast and enjoyable, but still tactical, give Suits a go.
  .
  If there's anything in there that's confusing or underexplained, please let me
  know, and I'll fit in something better!
  .
  There isn't currently a game to go with Suits, as it's a pure battle resolver,
  but we have two other Gambit editions, each of which have their own games. If
  you click through to my page, you'll be able to take a look.

  Do you know when to hold em? Know when to fold em? Then don't walk away nor run
  from Gambler's Heart!
  .
  Gambler's Heart is a 12-page, fully illustrated table top RPG, perfect for
  groups of 4-5 players (including the Game Master) looking for something quick,
  easy, and fun.
  .
  Players will take on the role of Gamblers, card sharps who once played a game of
  cards against a magical being... and won. Now imbued with mystic power, you'll
  fight to prevent the clandestine organisation known as  The CONTROL from
  destroying chance itself.
  .
  Gambler's Heart's basic mechanic is a miniaturised poker game, using dice rather
  than cards. A player casting a spell will square off against the GM, both
  betting their Fortune on whether their hand is stronger than the other's. If
  your dice fall short, you can call upon the magic Patrons of the Gamblers for
  aid - but be careful. If the Game Master figures out which Patron gave you your
  magic, you're in trouble. Better practice that poker face!
  .
  To play Gambler's Heart you only need:
  .
  Five poker dice and one ordinary six-sided die, or six ordinary six-sided dice.
  .
  A pencil and paper to take notes.

  Chance and destiny find themselves intermeshed in A Game of Changes.
  .
  Unravel and decipher the mechanics of these worlds, and journey through the 64
  unique puzzles that draw inspiration and teachings from the I Ching [Book of
  Changes], one of the oldest classic books in human history.
  .
  Its wisdom originates from philosophical and scientific observations of the laws
  which rule existence. It invites us to conscientiously look within, at one's own
  personality, character, perspective and purpose while inspiring us to discover
  the one unspoken, unmanifest, unchanging truth.
  .
  There is no predefined way, no set progression, no rights or wrongs, it's all
  about the choices you make.
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  Using the keyboard or a gamepad, you control the wise sage Confucius. In each
  level, your purpose is to open and reach the door, which will lead you to a
  different level.
  .
  As you discover the mechanics behind each element and symbol in the tiles, you
  are able to manipulate their position, in order to reach the door.
  .
  In each level, you'll be able to select the next-level's hexagram, so when you
  cross the door, that's the level you'll be playing next.
  .
  The final purpose is to visit and complete all 64 levels. More than just 64
  puzzles, the entire game is one big puzzle.

  Something tells me we're gonna be just as confused when we're done here. Maybe
  even more so...
  .
  Ghost Story is a story driven action RPG currently being developed by me as a
  solo project! I'm still very much a beginner at game-making but doing this
  project has taught me  a lot and I'm excited to learn even more as I continue.
  It's still pretty early into development but I have completed this demo of the
  prologue chapter for people to enjoy. :^)
  .
  This demo is playable with keyboard or xinput devices, and is available on the
  following platforms:
  .
  Windows
  .
  macOS (COMING AT A LATER TIME CUZ IM BROKE IM SORRY ;n;)
  .
  Ubuntu
  .
  Caution: There are a few scenes that those who are photosensitive should be
  aware of: (bright flashing lights, rapidly changing colors). However, there is
  an in-game option to dampen these effects. The game will ask you early on if you
  are sensitive to such things. (I'd also recommend answering yes to this question
  if you are streaming the game or recording video for a lot of people to see.)
  .
  Note: Configurable controls are only available for keyboard users at this time.
  Gamepad configuration is planned, though.

description:
  Beyond the forest lies a jagged rocky coast, where a small seaside village has
  observed the rites of Greentide for generations. Each spring as the first green
  shoots emerge, the village elders weave an effigy from sapling branches and
  seaweed, crafting the likeness of a young woman. The sculpture filled with gifts
  before it is cast into the waves as an offering to the Queen of Tides, along
  with prayers for a bountiful catch for their nets and protection from storms.
  This ancient tradition harks back to an age when the ancestors would crown a
  young woman as the Tide Queen and offer her to the sea in sacrifice. Chieftains
  and princes would travel far to attend the ceremony, pledging gold, jewels and
  the finest crafts of their settlements. To this day, local fisherman never leave
  shore without paying her their respects - for the tide, they say, must have its
  due.
  .
  Strange as the customs of an isolated village may be, it has not escaped the
  notice of keen treasure hunters that centuries of offerings and shipwrecks have
  left a great hoard of untouched riches beneath the waves. You know of the island
  offshore, where the offerings are tipped overboard. You have heard rumors of a
  deep cove there, just visible at low tide. Superstitious villagers avoid it, but
  you know better than to believe their tales.
  .
  Will you emerge with treasures long kept hidden by the sea? Or will you become
  another offering and join the court of the Queen Below the Waves?
  .
  Gift of the Sea, a tidal folk-horror incursion for Trophy Dark, was a runner up
  in the Trophy Dark Incursion Contest last year. Now you can seek the treasures
  of the sea yourself, and discover what truth there is to the fisherman's tales.
  .
  Rules for Trophy Dark are included.

  a delicate fluidity in both the characters it portrays and the style of play it
  boldly puts forward. it is as likely to melt your heart with its colorful charm
  as it is to give you chills when showing you its subtle somber notes."

  like it or not, trans furries are the future of this medium. [sasha's] games are

  What is Globetrotter's Guide to Greenery?
  .
  Have you ever found yourself in a situation where your mind just goes blank
  while looking for a description of the landscape? Did your players go for days
  through an almost-sterile jungle because you forgot how's that bloody plant
  called? Fret not, Globetrotter's Guide to Greenery got your back.
  .
  Each issue introduces a new biome, its signature plants, and a handy list of
  descriptors for all of the senses - now your player characters can not only
  'see' but also 'hear', 'smell', 'taste', and 'feel' the world around them.
  Devised as a quick reference during the game, each PDF covers one specific type
  of terrain.
  .
  Each of the ten plant cards includes:
  .
  a botanical illustration,
  .
  a read-aloud description of the 'Perception test' variety,
  .
  additional lore to share with characters who are knowledgeable about nature - or
  just wanting to check out the plants from up close,
  .
  enough inspiration to send your mind racing and spin it all into a memorable
  experience for the party.
  .
  But wait, there's more!
  .
  We've added more material to make the Globetrotter's Guides even better for you!
  .
  a description of the biome written with a fully-immersive experience in mind -
  perfect to just hand to the players as an in-game guide!
  .
  an analysis of the climate, the soil, and the anatomy of the biome, full of
  ideas for the game and worldbuilding prompts!
  .
  an introduction to the animal life - all the most interesting animals you can
  encounter!
  .
  a list of environmental threats and challenges!
  .
  a collection of events, views, and encounters that will make your game better!
  .
  What's growing on the grasslands?
  .
  Mostly grasses, not gonna lie. But that's not the whole story, so buckle in for
  a ride and discover the intriguing herbs, shrubs, and trees of the grasslands,
  as well as the science behind those seemingly endless seas of green. From the
  savanna to prairies to steppes and velds, Globetrotter's Guide to Grasslands
  equips you and the player characters with all that they need to make this hike
  unforgettable.
  .
  Take up the challenge and upgrade your world-building game with Globetrotter's
  Guide to Greenery. Your setting, your campaigns, and your players will all be
  happy you did!

  come to life in either standard play or in VR.
  .
  Inspired by real-world toy designs, every GNOG head is a miniature world to
  discover. Grab a bookcase and spin it to reveal a hidden pile of coins, slide
  levers to navigate a damaged ship through outer space, crank a wheel to cook a
  stew on the stove - each playful interaction generates lively feedback and
  surprising consequences. Set to a relaxing and dynamic soundtrack that evolves
  with each level, the surreal worlds and joyful puzzles of GNOG will have you
  turning heads.

description:
  Up to 4 players can cheer along with squad leader Samantha in this fast-paced
  game of telegraph cheerleading. When she yells "Gimme a B!", respond by entering
  in the real Morse code for the letter B. Go Morse Go! Arcade Edition has four
  game modes that will put your Morse code skills to the test:
  .
  Championship mode: Race against human or CPU opponents to enter random letters
  the fastest. Fill up your hype meter first to win!
  .
  Tournament mode: GMG!AE features its own single-player campaign using
  Championship mode's rules - enter the big tournament and face off against the
  best cheerleaders in the world, all from the comfort of your home. (This mode is
  automatically selected if you play Championship mode with one player.)
  .
  Survival mode: Cheerleading is a demanding sport, even via telegraph. Enter an
  endless set of letters, but make too many mistakes, and you're out!
  .
  Pep Rally mode: New to Arcade Edition, in this co-op mode, your squad has a set
  number of rounds to fill a shared hype meter. Will you hype up the crowd, or
  make them fall asleep?
  .
  Each mode has customizable rules that allow you to adjust the length and
  difficulty of matches. Players can also customize their appearance by unlocking
  new looks - accessorize, change your uniform, or show your spirit as different
  characters such as the Fighting Scootsies' mascot, the airhorn-obsessed cheer
  pup DJ POM, or world-renowned telegraph prodigy Morse Playing Chicken.
  .
  Go Morse Go! Arcade Edition's four difficulty levels ensure fun for all,
  regardless of your prior Morse code experience. Beginners can enter at the J.V.
  level, in which Samantha tells you the exact dots-and-dashes translation, and
  learn Morse code along the way (like I did while making this game). Seasoned
  telegraph veterans can ramp the difficulty all the way up to Remorseless, a
  lightning-fast test of your Morse code knowledge - there are also calibration
  tools available to set the Morse timing to match their own personal speed and
  play the game at their own pace.
  .
  Get hyped!

  GoNNER is a tough as hell procedurally-generated 2D platformer with roguelike
  elements, following the largely misunderstood and altruistic Ikk on a journey to
  cheer up his only friend in this world - a giant landbound whale named Sally -
  by searching for just the right trinket in the deep and dark places nearby.

  You will die. A lot. This is by design, but it's not made to feel unfair. You'll

  it's okay cause we have a lot of replacement heads you can use.
  .
  DAILY CHALLENGES! Only playable once a day. Levels are randomly generated but in
  this mode everybody plays the same world and use an identical loadout.
  Everything resets at midnight (Swedish time, UTC+1). Can you crush your
  leaderboard foes?
  .
  PROCEDURALLY GENERATED! Every time you play the game the levels will be
  different and present unique challenges and opportunities.
  .
  UNLOCKS! You'll be able to choose from a variety of passive and active abilities
  at the beginning of each run so be sure to experiment with all of them and find
  the play style that best suits you
  .
  SECRETS! Secret areas exist in the world of GoNNER, and these areas will get you
  different items that you can then always use from the beginning of each run.
  We're not going to tell you how you get to these areas or what the criteria is
  for even finding them because secrets, duh.
  .
  LEADERBOARDS! Kill creatures, get combos, score points, and brag to your friends
  how much better you are than them.
  .
  MUSIC! It's really freaking good.
  .
  Good luck.

  GOBLINS IN SHADOW is a roleplaying game about goblin resistance and revolution
  in an age of elven oppression. It's a world of clockwork and magic, of smoke and
  shadow. Players will take on the roles of a cell of goblin revolutionaries,
  working to undermine the elves and humans who have conquered their homeland and
  built an empire on its corpse. They'll advance their goals by taking on scores,
  missions that gather sympathy for their cause or take direct action against
  their oppressors, ending in a final attempt to assassinate one of the elven
  ministers ruling the city. To do that, they'll need to avoid being caught by the
  Watch or the Hounds, the elite special police of the city; they'll also need to
  balance their obligations to the various factions of the city, as well as their
  own personal obligations.
  .
  The rule of elves will be broken by goblins in shadow.
  .
  CONTENT WARNINGS:
  .
  Expected: death or dying; systemic oppression; body horror (each goblin starts
  play with a body part that is either modified or replaced with a prosthetic or
  elven body part, voluntarily or not at the player's discretion); classism;
  weapons
  .
  Possible: Physical or verbal abuse; excessive violence; hostages and kidnapping;
  blood; animal cruelty or death; drug use; guns; smoking
  .
  GOBLINS IN SHADOW is currently in Early Access, meaning it's a fully-playable
  game right now but needs work to achieve its final form. When you buy GOBLINS IN
  SHADOW you're helping me continue development on this concept in the future, and
  you'll be able to help by providing feedback on your experiences with the game.
  .
  GOBLINS IN SHADOW was originally written for #goblinweek2020.

  The current version of this game has an occasional game breaking bug in the
  first mini-boss. See the comments below for more information. I do not have
  access to the source at this time and will attempt to push a fix at a later
  date.
  .
  The tale begins in 1987, in the Olde Far Off Kingdom of Michigan. Local do-
  gooder Bill is standing obliviously in the street, smoking a self-rolled
  cigarette of what we'll assume is a legal substance. While consuming his
  cigarette's combusting contents, Bill is stung by a massive wasp. Like, no,
  seriously, a super big-ass wasp. Realizing his disdain for wasps, Bill sets out
  to eradicate the wasp scourge by attacking them with his mouth-based pellet
  shooting abilities.
  .
  Can Bill defeat the WASP KING and save the world from their horrible sting?
  .
  Find out by playing GOD, I HATE WASPS!
  .
  Three quick-fire floors in the Wasp Castle, complete with secret rooms.
  .
  Three Wasp Bosses, including the Wasp King
  .
  In-game timer and score grading show you your results, with ability to save

description:
  Because the world is ruined, it can be rebuilt.
  .
  Because we can die, we can change.
  .
  Because the past is dead, we may finally have a future.
  .
  What if D&D's approach to history and divinity was the exact opposite of
  reverential?
  .
  GODEATER is a serious attempt to build a game that can do everything D&D does,
  but is nevertheless resolutely not D&D in a funny hat. It is a game about
  problem-solving and tough choices, in a world littered with the cavernous bodies
  of dead deities. It combines some of the sensibilities of the OSR school of
  gaming with more up-to-date mechanics and a focus on characterisation. It also
  includes an intuitive magic system based around control and communication of
  elemental spirits, and an attempt to build a world a little beyond generic
  fantasy and all of its unfortunate implications.
  .
  The Core Rules are simple enough to fit onto three pages, but the included
  document packs in fifteen pages worth of additional content: Details about the
  world, a guide to GMing, six fully-detailed Gods to explore and devour, and a
  selection of items, threats and general weirdness for you to include in your
  campaigns. Hack it, mess with it, do whatever you want. I'm not your dad.
  .
  More stuff may be forthcoming for this system - adventure modules, more items
  and character cards, and so on - if there's any demand for it!

  These are times of trouble: the days are numbered. Legends told us about them.
  We have names for them in our sacred scriptures: the Ragnark, the War of Gods,
  the Apocalypse, the Arrival of Avatars, the Eternal Night, the Infinite Void.
  .
  The end of days.
  .
  But we are not alone, we are not powerless: the gods are walking among us. They
  are here to guide us, to save the world as we know it - or to help us reach the
  land of the Dead.
  .
  If we pray faithfully enough and prove our worthiness, perhaps we can be spared.
  .
  In Godsend you roam the lands as the avatar of your god, cursing mere mortals
  and presenting gifts to the chosen ones. Your memories are numerous, made of the
  lives of your predecessors, your power is almost limitless. Will you use it to
  fulfil the will of your god? Or, as the end times draw near, will you try to
  save the world?
  .
  Godsend is a standalone alternate setting for Legacy: Life Among the Ruins 2nd
  Edition written by Khelren and illustrated by Jess Taylor and Tithi Luadthong,
  focusing on epic mythology and the end of days.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  As you are masters of fate, random chance plays no role in this game. Play with
  an entirely diceless version of the Apocalypse World system, and bend the world
  to your will.
  .
  Embody one of six divine Domains - War, Trickery, Knowledge and more.
  .
  Play the avatar of another player's god, using one of eight Callings - the
  Angel, the Juggernaut, the Prophet and more.

description:
  What is this?
  .
  Gondola is a cooperative card game using a subset of a standard deck of playing
  cards using only the ace, 2-7, Jack, King, and Queen.
  .
  It is played in rounds, each of which have two phases (Loading and Delivery). A
  standard game of Gondola ends after three rounds, while a long game (called a
  double-shift) ends after six rounds.
  .
  The Loading Phase is similar to a game of Blackjack or Pontoon in which the
  players are trying to get a total value of 13 without going over. The Delivery
  Phase involves a  cooperative scoring of points.
  .
  Gondolieri and the Wakemaker
  .
  The players of Gondola are the Gondolieri, taking the place of the legendary
  canal-traversing figures of Pentola, singers of abjuring ballads and destroyers
  of the demons who lurk in the city's waters. Those demons are represented by the
  Wakemaker, who is the dealer.

description:
  Following in the footsteps of critically acclaimed Lydia, Good Mourning doesn't
  shy away from serious themes, but at the same time it's also a warm-hearted take
  on the little things that make everyday life worth living.
  .
  'The structure of Good Mourning is all about breaking the form. Traditional
  linear narrative is a poor fit for a digital game, for games revolve around
  choices and interactivity. And as software products games offer a possibility
  for randomly generated content. This is impossible for other mediums, such as
  literature and film. We see these factors as possibilities rather than
  restrictions, and we want to explore how deep this rabbit hole actually is.
  .
  Good Mourning combines visual novels into a collection of mini games.
  .
  Emphasis is on a story and players are encouraged to experience it through
  several playthroughs.
  .
  The story adapts to the choices players make, and portions of it are randomly
  selected to ensure replay value.
  .
  Replayability is also a key element in the story, as well as the ability to
  choose and how other people perceive you. Choosing differently has an impact on
  the story and how it is interpreted.
  .
  The interpretation of the story is where the emergent narrative comes to play:
  the player sees only segments of the storyline, and the bigger picture has to be
  formed through imagination.
  .
  Warning: The story depicts scenes of abuse, intoxication & strong language.

  A New Setting! - Gourmet Street, a collection of scattered and bizarrely
  connected alleyways, it seems to pop up in any settlement large enough to begin
  thinking of itself as a city. Stacked high in wood carts, laid out on intricate
  rugs, swimming in a myriad of sauces, food is the name of the game on Gourmet
  Street.
  .
  ONE MILLION Food Vendors and Menus! - Never eat the same thing twice! Generate
  from 8,000 possible unique food vendors and LITERALLY ONE MILLION possible
  dishes; ranging from Soft-shelled Crabman Sandwiches with Tzatziki sauce and Egg
  Coffee, to Myconid Zapiekanka in Pesto with a shot of Absinthe!
  .
  Food Factions! - From the hyper-radical (and slightly deranged) Neuvo Gastro-
  Alchemists, to the fanatical and militant Vinegar Knights, the food factions
  each come with their own wants, goals, and boons, IF you choose to serve them...
  .
  A One-Page Adventure: ESCAPE FROM GOURMET STREET! Help a pair (or trio) of star-
  crossed lovers escape from Gourmet Street in a Snake-and-Ladders inspired chase!
  Fend off rival lovers, food cart brawls and escaped dishes as you dash through
  the alleys of Gourmet Street!
  .
  And More! Monsters, magic items, and cookbooks for both Players and GMs to use
  and abuse!

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Grackle Teeth is a solo journaling game informed by the Wretched & Alone SRD.
  All you need to play is a deck of cards, a handful of regular dice, and some
  stuff to write with and on-the crummier the better.
  .
  ~~~----=====----~~~
  .
  You play as the last survivor of a human extinction event, an apocalypse on a
  massive scale. Buildings still stand, the sun still rises, and vegetation has
  reclaimed the works of humanity. Few animals roam the empty streets, and those
  that do are feral, ravenous, and relentless.
  .
  This is Austin, Texas, USA. Date unknown-the only time that matters is that
  between now and the next time you must go out to scavenge for supplies.
  .
  You have survived this long, but not for much longer. Food is scarce and
  terrible. Springs and rivers are clogged and poisoned. And the birds hunger for
  your flesh.
  .
  But still, you persist. You endure, because that's what humans do.
  .
  ~~~----=====----~~~
  .
  Grackle Teeth is a 6" x 6" 30-page zine designed for screen viewing. Watch this
  space for print copies coming soon!

  Info
  .
  Graveyard Shift is a #spooky FPS with unique game mechanics and a mise-en-scne
  that mixes both toonish and horror elements together! Yes, we did it.
  .
  You are fighting against restless ghosts and liches. They revolt, because too
  many graves are dug in the graveyard, whose keeper is you. Your purpose is to
  re-kill the undead! Your only friends are mushrooms, those you use to make
  mushroom bombs.
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  Your ammo is elemental mushrooms, there are 5 different elements of mushrooms
  those you collect from the ground. You create bombs with those elemental
  mushrooms (2 Fire, 1 Water, for example) using number keys 1 to 5. Your enemies
  also have elements; enemy's element and the elements of your mushroom-bomb
  determine the damage you deal. For example, you deal more damage to a Fire ghost
  if you prepare a bomb with Water mushrooms.
  .
  There are 2 types of enemies: Normal ghosts and liches. Normal ghosts are melee
  attackers, they use claws. Whereas, liches throw you stones and they are much
  stronger than normal ghosts.
  .
  Game modes
  .
  We have 2 game modes: Waved and Survival. You fight against 10 waves of enemies
  in the first. Survival lasts as long as you are alive.
  .
  Power-ups
  .
  There are 4 power-ups: Shield, Slow Time, Magnet, Infinite Mushrooms.

  A 50 page zine containing a complete RPG, brought to you by ZineQuest
  Kickstarter backers.
  .
  On the road to hell there was a railway line. An express train to the infernal
  city of Dis, crewed by furies and carrying treasure and souls to damnation.
  You're going to rob it.
  .
  The Great Soul Train Robbery is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players and
  1 gamemaster about Desperados robbing the train to Hell.
  .
  Spin an allegorical Weird Western yarn as your sharpshooters, fiddlers,
  homesteader widows, and other Desperados attempt a Hellish train heist. Will you
  claim your prize from the train, or be overcome, damned, or broken by the heist?
  .
  This game uses a simple system based on Rowan, Rook, & Decard's Honey Heist.
  Your Desperados are a motley crew with mixed motives, so they all have two
  stats: Lover and Sinner. Use one to make human connections and perform selfless
  acts, and the other to do dirty deeds and brutal acts.
  .
  You and your fellow Desperados have heard rumors of a fabulous prize aboard this
  Hell-bound train, and you've stowed away on the caboose to rob the thing. To
  claim your prize, you'll make your way forward through the train car by car,
  using your wits, guns, or heart to navigate obstacles-like damned souls
  challenging you to poker games, or Pinkerton guards patrolling with leashed
  hellhounds.
  .
  The Great Soul Train Robbery is perfect for low-prep or no-prep oneshot
  gameplay. The game is packed with tables of inspiration for you roll on or
  choose from, ensuring that every train car (and every play-through) is different
  and exciting.
  .
  When that lonesome whistle sounds, will you have the grit and the gristle to
  knock over the hell-bound train? Will you lose your own soul in the process?
  .
  In short, this zine will give you a game that:
  .
  Works for 2-6 players, plus one gamemaster
  .
  Offers a compact experience perfect for a oneshot
  .
  Uses the quick-to-learn Honey Heist system ("Sweetened by Honey Heist")
  .
  Provides all the materials and inspiration you need to pick up and play
  .
  Tells memorable stories of damnation or redemption among hell-bent Desperados

  Story: ~ 1849, Great Britain
  .
  After a malevolent cult enjoyed a continueing growth of popularity, it became a
  threat to all people who did not share their philosophy. In 1845, the cult had
  taken control by force over several city districts or even whole villages
  throughout Great Britain. Now, a priest is declared to sneak into one of those
  reprobated cities to finish a task, that multiple people had failed
  accomplishing before. Thats were our story begins...
  .
  What is Grime & Gaslight about?
  .
  Your task is to bless twelve crosses with holy water (for story and random
  mode).  Therefore you have got three phials, each containing one charge for a
  blessing. You have to carefully look around in the city for these crosses and
  stoups, since you need to refill your phials.
  .
  This game challenges your memory and orientation. Where have you been before?
  Where do you saw the last cross, you were not able to bless, since you hear
  something right behind you and had to keep going? Decide wise, when its time to
  spend holy water on a cross, for its your only defense against the unholy
  creature that crawls through the streets.

game: Grindhouse Games Volume I (USA)

developer: Black Eyed Priest Games
publisher: Black Eyed Priest Games
genre: Action;Adventure;Shooter
description:
  Grindhouse Games Volume I collects three games from the Black Eyed Priest
  catalogue and presents them with new levels, enemies, and content.  The three
  games that you receive are:
  .
  SHOTGUN -  A sidescroller shooting game where you play as a mother ready to dish
  out bloody revenge on the low life scum who kidnapped her son.  Fast paced
  violence and over the top characters abound throughout this game.  This version
  of Shotgun adds new rooms and new enemies, making it even more difficult than
  before!
  .
  WITCHING HOUR AT HELL HOUSE - A hellish escape the room puzzle/horror game!
  Escape the Hell House before the "Tall Man" arrives and maybe even find the root
  to all this insanity within the basement.  This version adds a new, never before
  seen puzzle and ghost to escape!
  .
  PEEPAW - Oh no!  Peepaw was messing around with the Ouija board and got
  possessed again!  Help find Meemaw and escape!  That's right, your good ol'
  grandpa has been possessed by demonic forces and is now attempting to murder you
  and your family!  Traverse a dark house, find your cousins for upgrades, and
  rescue Meemaw before you're all dragged to Hell!  This version features new
  Peepaw behaviors.
  .
  Action, horror, thrills, and chills are at your fingertips in this sleazy
  collection of retro madness!
  .
  There are free versions to all of these games right here on itch.io, so this
  "director's cut" package is a way to help me continue making games inspired by
  trash cinema!  They also of course come with some new bells and whistles if
  you're already a fan.

  unfolds over radically disparate time periods that may range from 4 days to

  and traces we leave for others after we are gone.

  .

  The weird machinery of the phantasmagoria sparks awake. The lantern-bearer
  braces herself against a broken pew, supporting the weight of the magic lantern
  against the rotten wood. Out of its flickering lens dances a ghastly projection.
  A phantom, this one with a bark and iron crown, wings made of thread and voice
  of vinegar. She and her gathered revolutionaries brace back, readying to enlist
  this revenant to their cause. They are one step closer to overthrowing the
  Ancien Regime, this time with a spectral guillotine. These are their secret
  stories. This is a guide to casting phantoms in the revolution.

  What's GUTS+?
  .
  We can't all be super-powered demigods on an epic quest to save the universe.
  Most of us are just normal people dealing with weird challenges or tricky
  situations. When you don't have access to supernatural abilities, it takes GUTS
  to work through them!
  .
  The GUTS+ System is a role-playing game system that allows you to live out wild
  adventures without straying too far from your own abilities in the real world
  while still leaving plenty of room to explore what's possible with tremendous
  growth! Improve your character's qualities to excel at certain activities and
  overcome more and more incredible tasks! Work with your Game Master and your
  fellow players to solve big problems together!
  .
  Interaction with the game world and all the characters in it is at the forefront
  of the GUTS+ System, and its generalized mechanics allow for nearly infinite
  settings and scenarios. The GM decides what's possible and what's available in
  the game world, and you can help sway their decisions. There's even a unique
  magic system to explore if you're looking to add a little bit more of the
  mystical to spice up your game world!
  .
  It's not always gonna be easy, but now you've got the GUTS to do what it takes!
  .
  Why GUTS+?
  .
  The GUTS+ System aims to give you as much freedom as possible:
  .
  It lays out a full set of rules without a specific setting or storyline so you
  can build your own or modify one you like. The goal is to provide easy-to-
  remember rules that let the Game Master build the world and decide the outcomes
  so players can focus more on collaborative storytelling, interpersonal
  relations, and free-form play.
  .
  GUTS+ stands apart with its "quality" system:
  .
  Rather than having set skills, GUTS+ focuses on individual, customizable
  qualities giving your character the ability to do things, and if they don't have
  one specific to the action, their success at performing tasks is dependent upon
  their base qualities:
  .
  Gumption, Utility, Thought, and Slyness.
  .
  Plus a unique conflict resolution system using only six-sided dice:
  .
  Roll one die for each level your quality has, and each die is interpreted
  individually to determine the outcome. So if your quality is level 4, roll 4
  dice, and the GM interprets the roll rather than taking a total or average.
  .
  RPG System?
  .
  Yep, this is an assembly-required tabletop role-playing game system with no
  stories or settings built in. Think of it like a game engine, but for tabletop
  role-playing-you can use it however you want with whatever story you want!
  Ultimate freedom!
  .
  That does mean that you need to provide your own plot and ideas, though. The
  Game Master chapter covers how you can build your own world, but you can also
  use existing stories and worlds to play however you want with the simplified
  rules system.
  .
  If that's too much for you, SKATER+ was released as an expansion to the GUTS+
  System with special rules for skating like in the Tony Hawk Pro Skater video
  games. It's the first official setting for the GUTS+ System, and it's a lot of
  radical fun! SKATER+ is free, so whether you use the settings and rules itself
  or simply look at them for inspiration, you'll hopefully be able to find a use
  for GUTS+!
  .
  This core rule book contains all of the information you need to learn how to use
  the GUTS+ system, how to use its unique optional magic system, and a full one-
  off adventure scenario to help you get started building your own games. All of
  the information in this book is freely available on the official GUTS+ website,
  but this provides a nice, printable format with custom images throughout.
  .

description:
  Introduction
  .
  You are a Hannukah goblin. After the Goblin King destroyed the  temple, you and
  the other Hannukah goblins were left without a home. Although you originally
  didn't believe in Hanukkah, Hershel taught you the values of Hanukkah:
  community, survival, and celebrating the small miracles in life. With Hershel's
  trials, you now embrace Hanukkah and the Jewish culture.
  .
  Your goal now is to convince the other Hanukkah goblins in the neighboring towns
  to embrace the spirit of Hanukkah. You won't be doing this alone though! You
  will work together with your goblin friends and have special items. On your
  adventure, you will meet townsfolk and other goblins. It is your job to spread
  as much Hanukkah cheer as you can before the end of Hanukkah.

  Haunted Memories is a game of crumbling secrets, childhood memories, and
  hauntings.
  .
  Haunted Memories is a GM-less game to be played with up to 4 players, all former
  childhood friends. Years ago, they survived the Haunting, a nightmarish entity,
  but now it has returned and has brought them back together. The bonds they once
  shared are ravaged by time with secrets, lies, unsaid feelings, and only their
  memories of the past can help them prevail in the Present Day. But some secrets
  and memories are best left in the past.
  .
  You will need a Jenga tower to simulate the crumbling secrets and personas of
  the past and the present.

description:
  In the before-time - your childhood, or perhaps those of your forebears - THE
  MALL stood king among shopping locales. People of all kinds flocked to them,
  swarming store after store, purchasing copious amounts of tie-dyed fabric and
  greasy food and novelty knives. But now the people are ,DEAD, and the corporate
  catacombs stand silent. Their only customers now are rats and cockroaches.
  .
  Of late, though, there have been murmurs in the emptiness - flashes of too-
  bright colors, flickers of wires and flesh, strangled electric sounds, almost
  like SCREAMS. Brave or foolish souls have returned to the sites of their pasts,
  spurred by curiosity. The few who have returned, amidst their gibbering, mad
  cries, spoke of change. Storefronts peddling wares that they do not contain,
  advertisements that flicker in the corner of one's eye, and distant, echoing
  footsteps, coming from everywhere and NOWHERE in the dust-suffused halls.
  .
  Your town bore one such DECREPIT MALL, a hopeful tourist destination long since
  abandoned by the few teens that frequented it. Yet you find yourself standing
  before it in the gloom, for the first time in years. Lights flicker from within,
  tinny music emanates from disconnected speakers. And a phrase BURNS in your mind
  as if carved with a burning knife...

  Roused by the crackle of static, a lingering sense of dread crawls across the

  crafted nightmare. You've tried to tell others, no one understands. A CRT you
  don't remember owning flashes to life. Frozen in place you look upon the
  flickering screen to spy a dismal, bloodied scene. A cracked and faded jewel
  case sits close beside. A pale grey plastic box sits in front, emitting a low
  whirring noise. Will you take to the controller or let yourself be taken over?

  The "Demo Disc" is not a physical disc (as amazing as that would be) as we don't
  have the time or resources to organise the can of worms that is monetization and
  physical production. We would need some sort of publisher to handle the money
  split and production if we were to sell a physical copy. There's also been some
  confusion over this, these games are all built on modern engines to evoke the
  feeling and aesthetic of late 90s games, the disk would not be able to run on
  any sort of hardware from the time. The demo disc is a free downloadable exe for
  Windows only. Supporting other operating systems would likely double or triple
  the work it took to organise the disc.

  The horrific times you had with the DEMO DISC 2020 are nothing more than a
  painful memory. It's been a year - life has gone on. You've survived. It's over.
  .
  Or so you thought.
  .
  Yet now you awake to find yourself in a room swathed in shadow, the memories of
  your arrival much too painful to confront in your uncertain state. The room is
  empty - save for one thing. A stone pedestal, nakedly imposing. Something wants
  you to approach.
  .
  And you do.
  .
  On the pedestal lies a lone, cracked jewel case. Your fingers run across the
  surface...
  .
  DEMO DISC
  .
  Without warning the darkness dies, sickly light flooding the room, and you find
  yourself in a massive building of stone walls and marble pillars. The air is
  cold yet stuffy, as if you breathe gaseous dust. A showcase - you stand within a
  showcase, a showcase of curious remnants of the culture outside this place, of
  the culture you'll never return to, and the shapes within the displays sting
  your eyes like glass needles...

  What is haunting?
  .
  Haunting is a two player game about a sentient House that wants to devour its
  Occupants.
  .
  During play, the players will work together to create their story, documenting
  the time that the Occupant spends living in the House and telling the tale of
  how the House will inevitably becomes vacant once more.
  .
  The House is waiting...
  .
  How will you play?
  .
  You'll create Occupants from prompts.
  .
  As Occupants move in they will leave their mark through adding or changing
  rooms. But the House will push back, twisting these rooms in spooky ways.
  .
  Player 1 (Occupant): the Gentlefolk add a ball room to host lavish parties.
  .
  Player 2 (House): the guests complain of inexplicable voices
  .
  Player 1 (Occupant): the Gentlefolk blame old pipes and insist that the party
  continues
  .
  In turn, the House will haunt the Occupants.
  .
  Player 2 (House): every few days when the Author is in the library, the book
  shelves will start to shake, knocking books to the floor.
  .
  Player 1 (Occupant): the Author flees from the room
  .
  Player 2 (House): as they run, the bookshelves start to tip over like dominoes,
  and they only just make it out
  .
  Finally, together you decide this Occupant's fate, will they Fight, Flee or Fall
  to the House?
  .
  As you wait for a new Occupant you'll Rest, with music on and your eyes shut,
  until the next Occupant moves in and you repeat the process until your story is
  complete.
  .
  Recording your story
  .
  The game asks you to keep a journal of the events as they unfold and record the
  changes to the house through a drawing of it.
  .
  You can draw one from scratch yourself or use the printable House template we've
  included:
  .
  Using sound
  .
  During play, you will prompted to listen to some small audio tracks as part of
  the game.  These tracks are currently under development and are due to be
  released as part of a future update.
  .
  In the meantime, feel free to use the excellent audio composed for the game
  Artefact by Jack Harrison. These tracks were created by the talented Christopher
  Michael Roberts and they work well for this game.
  .
  You can find them here: https://theartefact.vercel.app
  .
  Alternatively, feel free to use your own eerie music.
  .
  What will you need?
  .
  Two players that are feeling spooky.
  .
  A couple of hours.
  .
  Some eerie ambient music
  .
  A safe place to play in dim light.
  .
  A way to document your story in words.
  .
  Something to draw with.
  .
  Snacks!
  .
  Printed copies crowdfunded!

description:
  It is a fearful thing, to love what death can touch.
  .
  - excerpt from the Mourner's Kaddish, as attributed to Rabbi Chaim Stern
  .
  It is morning and your dog wants to talk to you. You know of a spell that will
  enable them to speak to you through your words; it will take all day, and you
  will labor through many tasks with them in order to enact it, but let the labor
  be a joy and they will be able to tell you everything that is in their heart.
  .
  This is an epistolary game for two players, one of whom is a dog. Within the
  construct of this game dogs think of humans as ageless, near-immortal, untouched
  by sickness or death except in rare confluences of time. You know this is not
  true; but it does not matter. You will spend play time looking at the world and
  yourself through the eyes of your dog as you spend a day together exploring,
  playing, and enjoying each other's company. The game will conclude with you
  writing a letter from their perspective, wherever they are in their life in
  relation to yours, to you, and then watching your dog as they dream after
  they've fallen asleep at the end of the day. Play time lasts one waking day, and
  the morning after.
  .
  Note: An updated version of the game will be posted in late summer, 2021.
  Previous players who've purchased or downloaded the game will be able to access
  the updated version without additional charge.

developer: Sealed Library
publisher: Sealed Library
genre: Adventure;Role Playing
description:
  What is this?
  .
  Have you Heard About the Beast is a game of tavern rumours and hearsay. You sit
  in a tavern or other location where the adventurous gather and share rumours of
  a foul beast that lives nearby. The locals join in, adding all sorts of
  colourful nonsense to the creature's description.
  .
  Thing is, every bit of it true.
  .
  Glowing eyes the size of shields and jaws that could crush your skull. Someone
  even told me it communes with the birds to learn out secrets.
  .
  It's true! And I heard it guards the hut of a long dead witch who knew the
  secret to eternal life. The one who slays it could live forever!
  .
  Hear it played
  .
  Go hear the game played over on Party of One Ep. 265!
  .
  It's all about creating ludicrous encounters with beasts for oneshots,
  convention games and sidequests in your regular campaign. Play the part of the
  tavern patrons sharing these rumours, than take your party off to confront them.
  .
  Have You Heard About the Beast? is broadly compatible with fantasy RPGs and
  highly adaptable to other settings as you provide all the stats for the
  creatures and content is flexible to suit your setting.
  .
  This game is played collaboratively with groups of adventurers and a GM, and
  will accommodate any reasonable RPG group size. The game comes with random roll
  tables that provide ideas but many of the best ideas will come from within your
  group.

  about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink,
  even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support
  current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?
  .
  After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you
  publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or
  perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and
  drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events
  about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers,
  or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?
  .
  On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and
  immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your
  brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and
  social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little
  girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day
  provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs.
  .
  But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen
  to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you
  watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your
  doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your
  doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of
  cash?
  .
  After good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a
  growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.

  Cortex is in ruins.
  .
  After waking from a five week coma, Theo Kavinsky finds his life in disrepair,
  and with no memory of the accident, it's up to Ted and Teddy - the conscious and
  subconscious voices in his head - to work out what happened, and put his life
  back on track.
  .
  Headspun is an FMV/Adventure hybrid which puts you in the shoes of Ted: the
  Director of Cortex - the rational, intelligent voice in Theo's head. What Ted
  thinks is best for Theo isn't necessarily a view shared by Teddy, however; the
  primal, emotional subconscious voice...
  .
  In the process of repairing Cortex, re-hiring a team and finding out what
  happened the night of the accident, Ted and Teddy must cast aside their
  differences and learn to work together. Headspun is a game about recovery,
  discovery, and the ongoing battle between logic and emotion.

game: Heartbreak High - A Break-Up Simulator (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/H/Heartbreak High - A Break-Up Simulator (USA)/Heartbreak High - A Break-Up Simulator (USA).json
developer: Alec Robbins
publisher: Alec Robbins
genre: Visual Novel
description:
  Imagine you're the most popular kid in school. So popular, in fact, that you're
  dating every single person in your class. The only problem? You've decided to
  break up with all of them, one by one.
  .
  Heartbreak High is an arcade-style spin on visual novels and dating simulators
  that asks you to break up with all of your high school sweethearts instead of
  woo them. A single play-through can be completed in one 20-40 minute sitting,
  with each break-up featuring a unique branching story path and lovable (or
  unlovable?) characters for you to crush beneath your feet over and over again.
  .
  If you couldn't already guess, it won't be easy. There's only 40 minutes until
  the end of the school day, and on top of that you must be careful not to act too
  cruel, too sexy, too selfish, and more... sometimes you'll have to stay tactful
  and sympathetic, while other break-ups will call for a somewhat firmer approach.
  It's as stressful as the real thing, baby!!!! And that's not even mentioning the
  various surprises and obstacles that'll get in your way!!!!
  .
  features:
  .
  over 15 unique choose-your-own-adventure-style break-up encounters (any less
  than that wouldn't have been stressful enough)
  .
  multiple playthroughs encouraged - try saying something different next time
  because there's some wild stuff in there
  .
  nearly everything on screen is hand-drawn (including the typeface and menus
  even!) which i think is very impressive don't you??
  .
  an extensive original soundtrack by Ronnie Dezsi that brings every character
  (and menu screen) to life
  .
  very funny writing (i know that's subjective but it's also definitely true in
  this case, sorry)
  .
  there's a bunch of mini-games!!! they're like little tiny games inside of the
  bigger game, if you can believe it
  .
  lots of fun characters that are cute and might make you sad to break up with
  .
  it's a cheap quick game that doesn't take very long to play!!! it respects your
  time!!! isn't that nice!!!
  .
  i made this game almost entirely by myself! my name's Alec Robbins! hello!
  .
  there's a FREE PLAY mode where you can't lose but you also can't get to the
  final level. it's also good for role-playing without penalty!
  .
  you can get chocolate in the game but you can't use it for anything. i should
  have taken that out of the game actually
  .
  a surprise ending... not allowed to say more... my apologies for even bringing
  it up in the first place...
  .
  maybe you can even choose NOT to break up with them??? would that give you a
  different ending??? maybe??? hmm???

publisher: Devolver Digital, terriv
genre: Shooter
description:
  Armed with a simple yet stylish revolver and six devastatingly plump bullets,
  you must reset the security mainframe to restore order and reap the rewards of a
  job well done. To succeed in the game, players will need to move carefully and
  make smart use of their bullets, items, and the environment as rushing into new
  areas is the fastest way to get killed in the untamed wild of the neon
  corridors.
  .
  Limited Ammunition
  .
  Begin each attempt to reach the mainframe with just six bullets for your
  revolver that must be picked back up after each shot and manually reloaded one
  by one - make them count.
  .
  A Plethora of Items
  .
  Discover items and perks to aid you on your way to the mainframe. From homing
  bombs and coin magnets to a teleporter and high heels, each item will change up
  your approach. Choose wisely as you can only carry one item unless, of course,
  you find a backpack.
  .
  Shopping and Banking
  .
  While death is permanent, money in the bank can live on for future attempts at
  reaching the mainframe. Make a deposit or withdrawal from one of many
  conveniently placed automatic banking machine throughout the facility. Or just
  blow your cash on a shopping spree - up to you.
  .
  Life Decisions
  .
  Invest in items like Life Insurance or a Last Will that, if carried during the
  time of your unexpected death, will save your money, bullets, bombs, and
  keycards for your next attempt.
  .
  Aggressive Creatures + Malfunctioning Security
  .
  Face down dozens of nasty creatures lurking around the colorful hallways and the
  now malfunctioning security drones meant to defend against those same creatures.

description:
  Build your fleet, trade, explore and conquer
  .
  Helium Rain is a single-player space simulation that places you at the helm of a
  spacefaring company. Trade resources, buy ships and stations to fulfill
  contracts ! Dock at stations to buy and sell you wares or upgrade your ship,
  upgrade your technology to be more efficient and militarize your fleet to
  prevent piracy.
  .
  You will need to master both real-time action and long-term strategy: destroying
  a freighter has a direct impact on the economy, while declaring war will make
  your spaceflight environment slightly more hostile...
  .
  13 playable ships with weapon and engine upgrades
  .
  Build and fly fleets of fighters, bombers, cargos, corvettes or capital ships.
  Buy new engines and weapons.
  .
  Fast-paced combat with Newtonian flight, localized damage and joystick support
  .
  There is no speed limit in Helium Rain. You can fly at half a mile a second
  while aiming backwards. Aim for critical systems in order to disable ships, kill
  their crew or capture targets, and don't fly into asteroids.
  .
  Complex economy model
  .
  Take advantage of a complex simulation of space trade to be the most competitive
  company.
  .
  A planetary system to explore
  .
  Explore around 25 sectors orbiting the gas giant Nema and its moons.
  .
  Procedural contracts, world exploration, technology upgrades
  .
  Pick contracts and build your empire to become the largest company.
  .
  Quick-action skirmish mode
  .
  Setup your fleet, pick an opponent and go into fighting action right away !
  .
  A world that feels real
  .
  Your ships have generators, radiators, weapons, engines, cargo bays or life
  support systems - they all work together. Every thruster on your ship plays a
  role. Aim for engines to pin down your enemies, or send them spinning around by
  destroying power stations. Most ships have more than thirty individual parts !
  You can customize the most important parts of your ships - your main engines,
  attitude control thrusters, weapons and hull colors.
  .
  Your competitors are independent factions, companies with the same goal as yours
  - ruling the system. They will try to undercut you, or even attack you if you
  become a threat to them. But don't be too quick to destroy them, as war can
  break the supply of resources you depend on ! Attacking freighters will destroy
  resources, with the potential to cause an economic crisis.
  .
  Recommended system
  .
  64-bits Windows or Linux system (32-bits systems are not supported)
  .
  Intel Core i5 or equivalent
  .
  GTX 970 or equivalent
  .
  4GB of RAM
  .
  5GB of free disk space
  .
  Linux-specific support
  .
  Linux is fully supported, with the following caveats.
  .
  AMD users should launch the game with the "-vulkan" command-line parameter (full
  command "HeliumRain.sh -vulkan"), using the open-source radeonsi driver.
  .
  NVidia users can encounter a NVidia driver regression causing the game to render
  entirely white. Until this is fixed by NVidia, affected users should prefix the
  launch command with "__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0" (full command
  "__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0 ./HeliumRain.sh"). We anticipate this issue to be
  resolved soon.

  Which really is an awful choice, but it's the best you've got.  Can you defeat
  the other competitors to escape from Golf Hell, or will you be trapped here for
  all eternity?
  .
  Hell Holes is a competitive fantasy golf dice game for 1-6 players.  Each time

  went.  Hopefully, you stayed on the course and did not stray into any of the
  fantastic dangers of the Circle you are competing on at the time.  As you play
  your way through the nine Circles of Old Hell Downs, the demonic Caddy will
  interfere by offering special clubs to whoever is in last place at the end of a
  circle.  Only by playing better than your fellow golfers (or maybe being luckier
  than them) can you escape Golf Hell!
  .
  You will need a pair of ten-sided dice (or an electronic dice roller, or a
  numbered spinner, or some other way to generate random numbers between 1 and 10)
  to play Hell Holes.

  Hello, World is set in a digital utopia, the eternal paradise of World.

  well. Here in the World, the only thing in short supply is Memory: a precious
  resource that lets Users like you sustain their fragile self-identity and forge
  lasting, meaningful experiences.

  You could live a life of complacent boredom, consuming stale entertainments and
  marking time in eternity until the clouds crumble to ashes around you. Some
  users choose to do just that.
  .
  But not you. You'll shake the gates of heaven until the angels are forced to
  write your name in the stars.

  If you want more Hello, World, check out the bonus playbook: The Daemon.

  You are a vampire, or a human, or a dhampir. You are either an interviewer on a

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Here & Far is a solo GM-less journaling game about being with another person,
  but unable to communicate with them.
  .
  The game uses scenarios to bring new  and very different context to the prompts
  on each play-through. It will include 4 very different scenarios:
  .
  The Coma: You are in a coma and need to reawaken so you can warn a loved one
  that they are in mortal danger.
  .
  The Afterlife: You are haunting someone. Is it someone mourning you?, is it an
  old grudge?
  .
  The Stakeout: You are watching an unaware subject. Are you police staking out a
  suspect? Are you are a thief that has hacked the security cameras of your next
  target?
  .
  ????: I want to leave the last scenario to the feedback of the ttrpg community.
  What theme would you like to see?
  .
  This game is in development and being itchfunded. So far, the game includes 2
  scenarios (The Coma and The Afterlife). Anytime the game reaches one the goals
  below, I'll write another scenario (up to 4), and then add $2 to the price. So
  buying early means you get it cheaper, with access to all future updates.

  Heros d'Argile raconte la gense, l'ascension et peut-tre la chute d'un (Super)
  Heros. C'est un jeu qui se centre sur le quotidien du Heros et de ses proches,
  sur les relations qu'ils entretiennent et sur le prix  payer pour tre le
  symbole, voire l'espoir, d'une cite. Loin des stereotypes de super heros
  invincibles et toujours triomphants, nous vous proposons au contraire de vivre
  les moments de doute du Heros, mais aussi les fragiles instants de grce qu'il
  partagera avec ses proches.
  .
  Heros d'Argile est un jeu de rle sans meneur pour 3  7 joueurs .  Il est ecrit
  par Manon et Simon LI, illustre par Hulver et quatre artistes invites.
  .
  Cette version Renaissance est la nouvelle version de Heros d'Argile. Elle
  comporte des textes revises et ameliores ainsi que de nouvelles illustrations,
  le tout dans un livre unique au format "comic book".
  .
  Il y a tant de raisons d'aimer le genre  super heroque . Pour le spectacle
  d'affrontements titanesques, pour la surprise du twist final, pour les enjeux
  planetaires (voire cosmiques), pour les thmes abordes, pour la proximite qu'on
  ressent avec les personnages, pour les causes et les luttes des heros, pour
  l'excitation des crossovers, etc. Et parmi toutes les raisons de s'interesser
  un Heros, celle que nous preferons est l'exploration de son quotidien.
  .
  Que fait Bruce Wayne entre deux missions ? Est-ce que Matt Murdock va finalement
  trouver du temps pour prendre soin de ses amis Karen et Foggy ? Comment jongler
  entre les preparatifs du mariage avec Mary Jane et les responsabilites de
  Spiderman ? Qu'est-ce qui rend Superman, Dieu parmi les Hommes, si humain ?
  .
  Voici ce que nous avons voulu mettre dans Heros d'Argile.
  .
  Comment le quotidien s'entremle-t-il avec la vie super-heroque ?
  .
  Dans Heros d'Argile, on raconte l'histoire d'un Heros et de son entourage, leurs
  relations, leurs apprehensions, leurs moments partages et, inevitablement, les
  menaces qui planent sur eux. On passe du temps avec les personnages, on apprend
  les aimer, on se delecte de leurs interactions, on apprehende les sacrifices
  qu'ils devront ineluctablement faire. Loin des stereotypes de super heros
  invincibles et toujours triomphants, nous vous proposons au contraire de vivre
  les moments de doute du Heros, mais aussi les fragiles instants de grce qu'il
  partagera avec ses proches.

  Heros d'Argile n'est pas un jeu de super heros. C'est un jeu qui parle de

description:
  Hex Kit is a multi-platform desktop application for building hex maps to be used
  with table top role playing games. Rather than being bogged down by features and
  complications, Hex Kit is built to be intuitive and quick to use with an
  emphasis on art.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Multi Platform: Hex Kit runs native on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  .
  Simple to Use: It has just the right tools you need to quickly put together a
  detailed map, as well as a few tools for displaying your map at the table.
  .
  Detail Variation: No need to hand pick each tile as you build your map; pick a
  hex style and the software randomizes the selection as you click and drag across
  the canvas. Tiles can be rotated and flipped with just a few mouse clicks as
  well. If you find the painting too broad, you can also select individual tiles.
  .
  Player Facing Display: Hex Kit has a display mode that shows your map in a
  separate window; drag it to a second screen or show it on a projector. You can
  hide parts of the map with fog of war and reveal the map as needed. Changes made
  in paint mode update in the display window in real time. Did your players burn
  that village down? Delete it from the map, and it's gone.
  .
  Store Information: You can store a label with a description for each hex
  directly in the map.
  .
  Custom Tiles: Hex Kit comes with a small selection of old school themed, black &
  white tiles that you can use to get started. You can create and import your own
  tiles, purchase and install official tile sets illustrated by CONE team members,
  install tile sets from 3rd parties, or even cobble together tiles made from
  images found around the internet!
  .
  Export: Hex Kit will export your map as a PNG file that you can print or even
  use with a virtual table top.
  .
  Random Maps: If you're in a hurry, or just want to goof off, you can generate a
  random map and then edit it to fit your needs. You can even save your generator
  to use again later.
  .
  Internal API / Plugin Support: Hex Kit boasts in internal API; users willing to
  dig in to a little bit of JavaScript can create, run, and share plugins to get
  an extra mile out of Hex Kit. Documentation on Hex Kit plugins can be found
  here, and an example plugin can be found here.
  .
  Both Types Of Maps: Hex Kit now supports tiles that either have points up or
  faces up.
  .
  Installation: Installing Hex Kit is easy: download the zip file and extract it
  wherever you want. All you have to do is open the executable and you'll be
  making maps in no time. Note: Hex Kit is not compatible with the Itch Client.
  .
  FAQ: This can be found at http://coneofnegativeenergy.com/hexkit/faq/
  .
  Tutorial: This can be found at http://coneofnegativeenergy.com/hexkit/help/
  .
  More Tiles: You can get some fancy new tiles like the ones used to make the map
  below, right here: https://cone.itch.io/. Again, the tiles in the image below do
  not come packaged with Hex Kit, and are available separate!
  .
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Screenshots on this page depict the default black and white
  tiles as well as imported tiles. Hex Kit only comes with black & white tiles,
  additional tiles can be downloaded or purchased.
  .
  Terms of Use: By purchasing or downloading Hex Kit you agree to the terms listed

  From the creator of Pony Island...
  .
  In a creaky old tavern, in a forgotten corner of the video game universe, a
  storm is raging. The barkeep gets a patchy phone call. It's hard to tell what
  the caller is saying, but this much is clear: someone in The Six Pint Inn is
  planning a murder.
  .
  There are six patrons; all of them are video game protagonists trying to escape
  their past... But The Six Pint Inn has a way of bringing back old memories. Each
  flashback plays out in an entirely different genre, sometimes blending multiple.
  By exploring these memories you may discover the identity of the murderer... or
  you may learn much darker secrets.
  .
  In The Hex you will...
  .
  Control the six patrons and explore The Six Pint Inn
  .
  Delve into the memories of these cast-aside game protagonists to learn the truth
  of their past
  .
  Learn the identity of the would-be murderer... as well as the victim
  .
  The Hex takes roughly 6 hours to complete on the first playthrough.
  .
  "A game that defies me to tell you anything about it, not that I'm convinced
  you'd believe me if I did."
  .
  - Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "I'm just gonna cut to the chase: The Hex is this year's Frog Fractions,
  Undertale, or-perhaps most aptly, given that it's from the same creator-Pony
  Island."

developer: aBigThinkGames
publisher: aBigThinkGames
genre: Puzzle
description:
  A simple yet challenging logic puzzle game currently in beta but nearing
  release! There are 92 hand made puzzles spread out across 4 difficulties along
  with an option to procedurally generate puzzles. All puzzles are guaranteed to
  require no guessing to solve. The puzzles can be generated with between 2-5
  colors, 5 different difficulty levels, and 7 different sizes. The puzzles are
  intended to be relaxing, so there is no time limit and no penalties for
  mistakes.
  .
  Played on a hex grid, you must complete two goals to solve the puzzles. The
  first goal is to find a path along the grid that connects two endpoints.
  However, as you make the path, the hex colors will cycle. The second goal is to
  get all hexes to the goal color. So you must find the path that results in all
  hexes reaching the goal color.
  .
  Color is a important part of the puzzle, but don't worry! There is a color blind
  mode you can enable in the settings which will add a unique pattern on hexes for
  each color if you need it.
  .
  About the beta
  .
  The core of the game, the puzzle generation and mechanics, are finished aside
  from any tweaking that may happen before full release. Most of what's left is
  finalizing the art style, working on the sound design, adding music, and general
  polish.
  .
  Buying the beta will get you access to all beta versions, and the full game once
  it releases, including a steam key once the game is on Steam. The beta is also
  at a discounted price! The full version will be more than $6.99.

  Hexed is a short game you can download for Windows. (I wish I could make it

  much less when you can't test it)
  .
  Initially I made it so I could show maps to a friend for them to use as they
  like but I liked the example story so much I just had to make it a full fledged
  title.
  .
  This is not for children as it contains themes of extreme violence, strong
  language and distressing situations.

  .
  There are two included documents: a black & white printable version of the core

  color character, reference, and GM sheets. The sheets can be printed in B&W

  There are stories hidden everywhere: on the table, and under it; in pillow
  forts, between floorboards, on park benches, beneath the ground, over
  uncomfortable green couches, and elsewhere.

  This is a guide to finding those stories, an atlas detailing their locations, a

  HIGHWAY BLOSSOMS REMASTERED
  .
  The update some of you asked for
  .
  Highway Blossoms: Remastered is the new definitive romance treasure hunt road
  trip experience. Most importantly, it's now fully voiced in English by a
  talented cast of actors. We've also remastered the soundtrack for a better
  listening experience, touched up the art for a better viewing experience, and
  added a Chinese translation for a better Chinese reading experience.
  .
  Highway Blossoms is a short yuri (lesbian) story set in the American Southwest.
  After an old gold rush miner's journal is discovered, supposedly detailing where
  he hid parts of his stash, a nationwide craze begins as would-be prospectors try
  to solve its clues and strike it rich.
  .
  Amber couldn't care less. Wandering the desert in a recently-inherited
  motorhome, she mourns the loss of her grandfather - indifferent and unaware of
  the hunt happening around her. It's not until she meets Marina, a young
  hitchhiker lost in New Mexico that the girls get swept up in the rush.
  .
  At least tens of words, maybe even hundreds. Although the last word count puts
  it around 90,000, so expect 6 or so hours of reading.
  .
  Grand, hand-painted vistas of actual landmarks in the western United States, all
  in glorious 1080p detail.
  .
  A huge soundtrack featuring the works of Smoke Thief, Jake Abernathie, Able
  Kirby, and other friends. Sounds right at home on your in-dash cassette tape
  player.
  .
  Accessibility options for days, including the ability to skip through everything
  in less than five minutes. But who would wanna do that?
  .
  Very serious additional game modes
  .
  Highway Blossoms: Next Exit - DLC Released!
  .
  Return to Las Vegas with Amber and Marina in this new Highway Blossoms story! A
  couple months after the events of the first game, the two girls return to the
  desert city for an alien-themed convention and to see Tess for her birthday.
  They also end up reuniting with Cassi, the candy shop girl, who's determined to
  start following her own dreams.
  .
  Brand new story and scenario with multiple viewpoints. Some sections follow
  Amber and Marina, while some sections follow Tess. Additionally, there are
  certain parts where you can choose to read from Amber or Marina's point of view.
  .
  New character expressions and outfits, as well as gorgeous new CG's and item
  cut-ins
  .
  Full voice acting featuring all the original cast
  .
  Several new musical tracks from a variety of composers

  About the Game:
  .
  Home is a unique horror adventure set in a beautifully-realized pixel world.
  It's a murder mystery with a twist-because you decide what ultimately happens.
  .
  Awakened by an oncoming storm, you open your eyes to discover yourself in a
  strange, dark room-tucked away in a house that's not yours.
  .
  As you play the game, it changes-subtly, almost imperceptibly-to reflect your
  perspective. It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its
  truths are entirely subjective.

  A low-poly epistolary game where you navigate a messenger pigeon through a city.
  During your journey, you hear the contents of the letter you're delivering. This
  game is SAD and QUEER. Read an article about it at Gayming Mag here.
  .
  The game doesn't have a tutorial (I'm sorry) so to play, use A and D on the
  keyboard or the left stick to move, and the mouse or the right stick to look
  around. P or the top button on the controller will pause, where you can adjust
  settings like volume and subtitles. The buildings in blue are significant points
  that will provide different bits of narrative if you fly over them. There are
  two endings.

  download the correct file for your setup, noted with (Keyboard) or (Controller).

  NOTE: If you have a Mac running Catalina, you have to launch the game from the
  itch app, otherwise Catalina won't run it properly!

developer: Zargo Games
publisher: Zargo Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  In 1955 the police station of Hopkinsville, Kentucky was swarmed by members of
  the families that shared a farmhouse just outside of the town. They reported
  that the house was under attack by extra-terrestrial creatures, but a police
  investigation only uncovered bullet holes and shattered windows, and evidence
  that the families were mostly drunk at the time of the incident. The aliens
  reported in the story became known as the "Hopkinsville Goblins", and became an
  infamous local cryptid, though there were no reported sighting since. Experts
  believe that a combination of alcohol, a meteor sighting, and aggressive owls
  led to the supposed sighting. This game is inspired by that story, told from the
  perspective of the owls.
  .
  Hopkinsville Goblins are owls trying to scare off a group of drunk vacationers.
  The players are a group of outlaw owls hiding from the law in an abandoned
  building until a group of rowdy vacationers moved into the building and forced
  you out. Fearing discovery by owl law, you decide that your only option is to
  scare them away using the same grift you used back in the day: alien
  impersonation.
  .
  This is a game for two to four players, with no GMs. The game is played in a
  series of six loosely-structured scenes. You need an eight-sided die and at
  least three six-sided dice to play.

  Hope is Not a Plan
  .
  A solo journaling game in which you will document your attempts to deliver a
  very complicated engineering project on time and under budget.  You hope for
  success, but you will most likely fail, damage your reputation, and lose your
  job. So it goes.
  .
  A Game of Conflicting Responsibilities
  .
  Your company has entrusted you with millions of dollars of other people's money.
  They expect you to please the client and turn a profit at the same time. On
  paper, it looks pretty straightforward. However, your client, your team, your
  company leadership, and your friends and family also have needs which complicate
  the execution of the project. You might even occasionally want to take care of
  yourself. Good luck!
  .
  Content Warning
  .
  Your character in this journaling game will never be at risk of physical harm.
  However, Hope is not a Plan includes themes of stress, professional
  disappointment, failure to meet obligations to friends and family, getting
  blamed for things you have no control over, and job loss.
  .
  FAQ
  .
  What is a "solo journaling game"?
  .
  This is a role-playing game, but you play by yourself, not with a group at a
  table. The game will present you with various situations and you write about how
  you think the story unfolds. Your character is a project manager for a complex
  engineering project - but it doesn't have to be you. The game has some
  explanations about the various types of engineering and how they fit together in
  big projects. Feel free to make up the parts you don't know.
  .
  How do you play?
  .
  You use a deck of cards, a 6-sided die, and a tumbling block tower (the game
  Jenga is an example) as your tools for the game. You'll also need some markers
  to track milestones (coins, poker chips, something like that) and a way to keep
  your notes. (If you don't have a tumbling block tower game available, don't
  worry, there are alternates suggested.)
  .
  The tower of blocks represents your mental capacity to handle stress and keep
  all the tasks in your project straight. The 6-sided die tells you how many cards
  to draw for a turn. The cards point to the writing prompts in the book, which
  describe events that come up during your project. Many of the prompts say to
  "pull from the tower" which means pull a block from the lower part of your tower
  and balance it on top. Some die rolls will let you achieve milestones in your
  project. If the tower falls before you deliver the project, you lose.
  .
  "If the tower falls, you lose" is the key game mechanic for the Wretched & Alone
  games. I've added a New Game+ mode, where each time you start again, you can
  remove troublesome cards from the deck, so with experience it gets easier to
  win, just like real project management.
  .
  Where did this come from?
  .
  This game leverages the Wretched & Alone SRD with much gratitude. It was created
  for the #WretchedJam, hosted by @pangalactic and @sealedlibrary in 2020.
  Portions of the content are based on the Make a Wretched Game template by Litza
  Bronwyn, and are used with permission.
  .
  Can I buy this in print?
  .
  Yes! Limited supplies are available in many different time zones.
  .
  Monkey's Paw Games has the printed zine (Canada)
  .
  Loot the Room has the printed zine (UK)

  Secret Cat Shop has the printed zine (UK)

  A game about the struggle to have a conversation while also stuffing your face
  with food.
  .
  You are at an all-you-can-eat hot pot restaurant. You're hungry, and you just
  want to do nothing but chow down.
  .
  But you're here with a friend, and you don't want it to seem like you're only
  here to eat!
  .
  Can you manage to keep up a conversation while cooking and filling your belly?
  .
  Features
  .
  Cook delicious meat, veggies, and tofu in a tasty broth until they're just
  right!
  .
  Multitask your way through three meals! You'll be cooking and eating while
  keeping up a conversation with your friend. Make sure she never figures out
  you're really just here for the food...
  .
  You get to direct the convo, but make sure you're ready to keep up with your
  friend's comments - she'll ask you what you thought about what she said later,
  and if you don't get it right, things could get ~*awkward*~

  Rock Paper Shotgun: "...playing it has made me very hungry, so I'm off to go

  .
  PC Gamer:  "... the arse-tightening tension of Hot Hot Panic, a game about
  trying to hold a conversation while stuffing your face with meat and potatoes."
  .
  Waypoint: "This game scratches two very important itches for me: time management
  mechanics, and the aesthetics of delicious animated food. Also, it's a great
  excuse out of any friend dates you may have coming up...just saying."
  .
  The Verge:  "...it manages to take the fairly universal social situation of
  trying to talk and eat at the same time, and turn it into a clever and fun
  game."

  Good: Full texture sizes and no anti-aliasing. Vsync!
  .
  Normal: Full textures with 2x anti-aliasing. Vsync!
  .
  Fantastic: Full textures and 4x anti-aliasing. Vsync!
  .
  Too Much: Full textures and 8x anti-aliasing. Vsync! This is overkill and
  Fantastic looks better. But if you really want to, it's there.
  .
  I recommend playing on good or normal, but fantastic is optimal.

  A Major Arcanum of the Tarot has chosen you as its agent. Now, every mirror is a

  .
  House of Cards is a modern fantasy story game using Tarot cards (or other
  playing cards) in innovative ways throughout the system: for character creation,
  conflict resolution, status tracking, and more. Set in a reflection of our world

  .
  A red dash is spotted in the night sky above a dying, bitter Earth. North
  America has given birth to an unforgiving wasteland, and a foam of techno-
  worshiping desert tribes has boiled out of the landscape's shattered bones. In
  the midst of the chaos, scattered pockets of civilization fight to reclaim
  normalcy among the wreckage. The city of Savannah, a once flourishing
  metropolis, has been newly repurposed as a respite from the unremitting heat.
  Fighting, however, remains a constant, with residents taking up crime,
  corruption, or vigilantism to survive.
  .
  In search of something greater than their broken lives, many individuals turn to
  the red, speckled light out of misplaced hope or unplaced obligation. What lies
  at the center of this mysterious incident? Is it redemption? Aliens?
  .
  Not even the maddest of Maxes could save these fools.

  that heals teammates from the sidelines? The choice is yours.
  .
  Purchasable equipment with in-game currency. Trade and barter with other players
  for the best deals. When everything has a price, even the shopkeeper might be
  open to bribes.

  Memlog Hunter.10/thmw1: 'Lost in space. Surrounded. Strange structures that
  build themselves - hive-like. And at their core, alien starcells... Must get
  home. Back to Hunter's Moon. Must... survive! Am attacking now - full thrust -
  cannons locked in - FIRE!' Little do you know what you face: over 180 levels of
  galactic mayhem. Hope you are a CLEVER psychoblaster - or else...'
  .
  Originally released in 1987, Hunter's Moon is a strategic shoot 'em up set in
  deep space. Beautifully presented and thoughtfully designed, the game became an
  instant classic thanks to its measured balance of strategic planning and
  psychotic blasting. Boasting one of the earliest uses of procedurally-generated
  content in a computer game, Hunter's Moon pushed the boundaries of the genre and
  helped redefine what a shoot 'em up could be.
  .
  Hunter's Moon Remastered is a fully remastered, overhauled, and updated version
  of the seminal C64 shoot 'em up. The game has been remastered for C64 cartridge
  and boasts a host of amazing new features including over 50 new levels, 5 new
  star systems, new level types, new music, new playing modes, stunning intro and
  outro sequences, built-in level editor, and enhanced presentation including
  foreign language support.
  .
  After flying your trusty ship Hunter too close to a black hole, you find
  yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling,
  hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien Starcells -
  these contain valuable navigational data and must be collected to plot a course
  back home.
  .
  The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the Starcells, a
  task made more challenging by the invincible Worker cells which patrol the
  cities repairing any damage inflicted. These Workers also bring the hive's
  defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted
  by using your ship's trusty Perma-Shields.
  .
  The game features over 180 levels spread across 21 star systems. When all the
  Starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the Bonus Game where you
  can earn a Perma-Shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within
  each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect
  four flashing Starcells you'll automatically jump to the next system.
  .
  As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of
  diverse and challenging hive types, including Attackers that throw out deadly
  spores, Darkcells which are only visible on radar, Switchers that change
  direction without warning, Jumpgates which jump to random locations, and
  Blackouts which plunge the hives into darkness.
  .
  Do you have the dexterity, precision timing and psychopathic blasting skills to
  find your way home to Hunter's Moon...?

  The downloadable C64 digital version is designed for use with a C64 emulator -
  it cannot be used with an EasyFlash cartridge, 1541 Ultimate, or Turbo
  Chameleon. We recommend playing the game using VICE 3.1+, a popular emulator
  compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  .
  Therefore, there are two downloadable versions, one containing the game files,
  the other containing the game files plus a version of the VICE emulator. Both
  versions include a simple .BAT file to make running the game much simpler.
  Please be sure to consult the README file for more information.
  .
  Bonus: The downloads section now includes a special version of the game created
  especially for the C64 Mini, along with a "CJM" configuration file. Note that
  game saving is disabled in the C64 Mini version, both during the game and within
  the level editor - it is therefore necessary to use the C64 Mini's built-in save
  functionality to save your game and your level designs. Again, please consult
  the README file for more information.
  .
  The cartridge version of Hunter's Moon Remastered includes a cartridge, game
  manual, cover art postcard, and Thalamus sticker.  Status: Out of Stock!

  Extra features

  .
  Level editor that allows you to create levels and share with friends
  .
  You can now save and load your progress during a level, so you don't have to

  you left off.

  You can slow down time, to make specific tricks easier to pull off.
  .
  What is the game about?
  .
  For those who don't know what this game is based on, Supaplex used to be a
  popular Dos game that was developed in 1991 by mainly Philip Jespersen and
  Michael Stopp. It was a difficult but rewarding game. Many levels require you to
  think thoroughly before making any move.
  .
  The main character is called Murphy. His goal is to reach the exit of each
  level, in order to do this he must collect enough infotrons (atom like objects).
  However, in order to collect these objects you have to puzzle your way though
  levels where you have to think before you act. Making it a difficult but
  rewarding experience.

  FAQ
  .
  What do I do in Hyperspace Dogfights?
  .
  Mainly you fly a jet in a 2d environment and blow things up. You'll also
  complete randomized goals in order to finish individual waves. In-between waves
  you'll buy items that modify your jet in various ways. Zones end with random
  boss encounters. Difficulty is pretty harsh, you'll probably die a lot in the
  beginning. But each subsequent run will play out a little different. Throughout
  the game you'll unlock additional items to find on later runs. The game is
  fairly light on story, but you can piece together a narrative from item
  descriptions and combat chatter if you choose so.
  .
  Feature list?
  .
  - Juicy, impact-full and tense 2d air combat, framed in a weird sci-fi universe
  .
  - 5+ player jets to fly, all coming with 2 alternate starting loadouts to unlock
  .
  -200+ different passive items, some providing simple bonuses, some completely
  changing how your jet behaves
  .
  - 90+ sci-fi jet weapons, including beam weapons, explosives and aerial melee
  options
  .
  - 50 active items used for offense, defense or utility
  .
  - Strong focus on synergies and weird jet builds. Most items will interact with
  others, be it in positive and negative ways. All passives can stack with
  themselves.
  .
  - 7 zones with distinct enemy composition to explore
  .
  - 10 bosses to die against
  .
  - Various wave goals: Hunt ace pilots, raid ground targets, perform recon scans
  and more
  .
  - 12 late game challenge modes that can be freely combined with another
  .
  - Colorful pixel art, powered by the Pico8 16 palette
  .
  - An adaptive soundtrack with combat and menu tracks, consisting of 14 tunes by
  ENUIT and Ole Toensen
  .
  - Persistent unlocks with lots of items in the loot pool from the get go, but
  some things only unlockable through the endgame
  .
  - Finished runs can seamlessly transition into endless mode if you choose so
  .

  (Mac users: This does not work on macOS Catalina (ver 10.15) or later. There's
  also been a couple reports of issues playing the game, so please try out the
  demo before purchasing.)
  .
  In 'I Have Low Stats But My Class Is "Leader", So I Recruited Everyone I Know To
  Fight The Dark Lord', or 'IHLSBMCILSIREIKTFTDL' for short, you primarily play as
  the main character Josephine, fated to defeat the Dark Lord. However, as she's
  generally unskilled in combat, she recruits literally everyone in her hometown
  to fight enemies with a party of 99 characters!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Nearly 100 characters to recruit and use!
  .
  A decent variety of skills and equipment for each character!
  .
  24 different elemental types, from Slashing and Fire to Legal and Financial
  damage!
  .
  Plenty of status effects! Become Absolved, drown in Bloodlust, and deal with
  Allergies!
  .
  No leveling system; with so many characters, that's just excessive!
  .
  Rather than an open world, have a simple level-based world map! Never worry
  about missing out on anything!
  .
  Everything from boss fights to cutting hair in a combat setting!
  .
  Puns! Mostly relegated to item descriptions and such, but if that's a selling
  point for you then great!
  .
  There are over 20 worlds and 100 levels to go through! You can try the demo that
  includes all of World 1 below. If you enjoy it, please consider supporting the
  development by purchasing a copy!

  v1.1 update: Memory leak issue resolved (for everyone, hopefully), level titles
  fixed, tileset collisions making for awkward cutscenes fixed.

  been fixed.
  .
  v1.2 update:  major bug/scene fixes, "unique element" battle help, certain
  fights adjusted to be easier, additional boss added, some mp cost balancing.

  i hurt myself -+- postjam edition

  is a short Bitsy game based on the original jam version from 2018. I decided to
  update it to be something I could be more proud of, since it's my most viewed

  This version is greatly expanded, and is almost entirely a new game, so "postjam

  .
  A not-so-generic otome game with BL possibilities.
  .
  Instead of playing the heroine and choosing between several men that have
  typical dating-sim personalities, you play as the childhood friend. That's
  right! The route that's usually the easiest to complete is no longer available.
  You (Geum Park) are thrust into the world of a reverse harem, where your
  precious childhood friend (Emily Carter) is being hit on by two of your
  classmates (Ao Yazawa and Hong Yang Chan). You can choose to either play the
  role of a love interest and try to win the heroine's heart, or... you can play
  your own game and try to make the two boys fall for you instead! The choice is
  yours!
  .
  Note: The game takes place in Australia, so there are times when the characters
  may say things that seem a little odd to people not familiar with Aussie
  culture.
  .
  Additional Note: Australia is a multicultural place, a good majority of the
  population speak more than one language. As such, in certain routes the
  characters may end up speaking to one another in different languages.
  .
  Game Features [1.1.0 Update]:
  .
  - A spin on your everyday otome game

  If you're into if not us, you'll probably like my upcoming visual novel
  Amarantus! It's about loyalty and loss and screwing things up. It's less of a
  downer...mostly.
  .
  Seven years ago, five heroes were brought together to save the world. Their
  success came at the cost of their leader's life; the secret behind it cost them
  their friendship.
  .
  Now they've been summoned for a new heroic quest.
  .
  if not us is about the moment when they realise everything isn't going to be
  okay.
  .
  The demo above includes two of the five vignettes.
  .
  Included on the Nebula Awards Suggested Reading List 2018
  .
  if not us [is] sort of like if you made Watchmen a D&D party of fantasy world
  saviours instead of superheroes...one of the best text-based games I found in
  the Itch.io Racial Justice Bundle - First Five
  .
  if not us is splendid; wonderful...it's five eulogies and five broken hearts,
  and again, and again. I cannot recommend it enough. - Damon Reece, lead writer
  of Necrobarista
  .
  if not us is a must-play for anyone who tells people's stories. It's sort of
  about what happens after destiny is done with you, and it plays with format
  phenomenally, and I love it. - Nissa Campbell
  .
  A collection of heartbreaking vignettes...obscure at times, but deliberately and
  productively so. - Cat Manning
  .
  Five short stories from five alternate timelines, each from the perspective of a
  different character and with new insight into the overarching narrative.
  .
  Each story has its own style of interaction: watch your life flash before your
  eyes, write a letter to your loved ones, plead your case, or just stand still
  and think for a while.
  .
  Some of our heroes may yet turn away from their deadly fates, some may succumb,
  and some may need convincing.
  .
  Nearly 30,000 words of branching narratives.
  .
  The stories in the anthology can be played in (nearly) any order, but you might
  find yourself revisiting one or two later with new insight.
  .
  I hope you like dramatic irony.
  .
  And big women with horns.

  .
  You are Iki, a tiny fey creature.
  .
  Your life begins and ends in the span of a single day.
  .
  And it's going to be wondrous, full, inspiring, romantic, adventurous, dramatic,
  joyful, sad ... meaningful.
  .
  You are going to be born, grown up, mature, grow old and eventually pass away. A
  full life, rich and vibrant, flowing with the hours of the day.
  .
  Ikigai is a game about finding meaning and fulfilment in the little things. It's
  about courage and discovery. It's about how life is transient, and how this is
  not a bad thing. It's about beginnings and ends, about growth and rebirth. About
  how grand and epic a tiny life can be.
  .
  Most people are afraid that this game could make them sad because the
  protagonist dies after what seems like a terribly short time.
  .
  But then they play.
  .
  And they smile.
  .
  Ikigai is a feel-good ride, getting to know a tiny amazing friend, making
  memories with them, watching them learn and grow, struggle and overcome. And
  eventually letting them go, but with a feeling of peace and joy because you got
  to know them, and they will now always be with you.
  .
  And then, sometimes, the end is not quite as we expect it to be...
  .

  .
  Born as an entry for the 200 Word RPG Challenge 2018 it was then developed into
  a full grown game. The PDF counts 12 pages that include a full actual play
  report, a printable Chronicle Sheet, and all the rules and explanations needed
  to play.

  It's very friendly to new players and highly rewarding for experienced ones.

game: Importance of Being Convergent, The (USA)

developer: Xavid
publisher: Xavid
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Tetrana is a small but ancient and prosperous kingdom. Its most distinctive
  feature is its strong caste system, which divides every individual into a rigid
  caste based on affinity to one of the four elements: Air, Fire, Water, or Earth.
  Each caste has rigidly defined roles and a strict place in the social hierarchy.
  .
  Most unusually, however, every 100 years a mystical Convergence of the four
  elements reshapes the structure of Tetranan society, allowing the caste
  hierarchy to be realigned! This is obviously a most important event, and you are
  privileged to represent one of the four castes at the Convergence, with the
  power to determine if a Realignment will occur. You do this, of course, by using
  your elemental gems to summon your spirit butterfly. Because everything about
  Tetrana makes perfect sense.
  .
  Of course, it'd be highly improper for anyone to pretend to be a member of a
  caste they are not, and especially so at such an important event that will
  decide the future of the country for the next century. So you have every
  assurance that everyone is exactly who they appear to be.
  .
  "The Importance of Being Convergent" is a short game of politics, secret
  identities, and romance, but primarily ridiculousness. It won 2nd place in the
  Iron GM contest at Intercon N. It is optimized more for roleplaying, humor, and
  dramatic scenes than for cutthroat competition, and has few mechanics.

developer: KRITIQAL

genre: Role Playing
description:
  It is a common misconception that who we are is a matter of chance. The
  imperceptible alignment of planets, mysterious genetic relationships, a token
  bestowed by each person we meet. All of this is true, but we forget that we are
  also a choice.
  .
  We are the narratives told by and about us, what we do and what we forgo. We are
  immaterial and we are present. We know ourselves and we know we are not fixed.
  But there is still a magic in this knowledge. The practicality of our self does
  not discount the incantations we cast, the stars we interrogate, and the
  divinity we invite inside.
  .
  This manual is a means by which we can navigate these bodies. We draw cards and
  seek answers inside us. They can be illuminating, uncomfortable, perplexing, and
  expected. They bring us closer to ourselves, be it a self known or discovered.
  .
  The stars watch and speak in archetypes. We align ourselves to them, and in
  doing so create stars of our own.
  .
  In me, a constellation is a comic destiny personality quiz told through tarot
  cards and improvisational introspection. It's designed for solo play but could
  be adapted for more players (or as an aspect of character creation for another
  game).
  .
  No prep, no GM
  .
  45-60 minute sessions
  .
  Play with any tarot deck (or use your real natal chart)
  .
  Lots of astrology flavor
  .
  Inspired by the many works of Jammi Nedjadi and Maria Mison.

  Content warning: explores themes of dysphoria, symbolic violence, sex, and
  anxiety. Be kind to yourself while playing.

description:
  "In My Friend Carrie's Car" is an autobiographical text-based game. While
  driving one town over to buy some plants with a friend, you find yourself
  thinking back on some things that have happened over the last few years.
  .
  Content warnings: eating disorders (including some representations of unhealthy
  and damaging eating disorder thought processes), obsessive-compulsive disorder,
  intrusive thoughts, depression, reference to sex via discussion of birth
  control, self-harm mention. I want to really stress here that the
  representations of damaging eating disorder thought processes could especially
  be triggering to folks. I pretty directly wrote out versions of some of the
  thoughts I had during these periods of my life, many of which are from well
  before I was in recovery from my eating disorder.
  .
  This game discusses some of my experiences being mentally ill. Everybody
  experiences mental illness differently. This game is meant to be representative
  of some parts of my experiences, and no one else's. I am not claiming or
  attempting to represent a universal experience of mental illness (because there
  isn't one), but, rather, just one manifestation - my manifestation. Maybe our
  experiences look totally different, and that's fine. Both our experiences are
  valid, even if they look nothing alike. This game is also not an attempt to
  represent the whole of my experiences. It's just showing little parts.
  .
  Press the highlighted keys to choose your routes. You can press ESC or Q to quit
  at any time. Please play the game at an aspect ratio of 16x9. The game is best
  played with sound. I prefer it with headphones in. It's up to you, though.
  .
  Here are some resources and little things that have helped me. Maybe they'll
  help you, too.
  .
  information on the symptoms and triggers of misophonia
  .
  OCD Center of Los Angeles has a website with some descriptions of manifestations
  of OCD that I've found really helpful on a few occasions
  .
  bedroom pop band Adult Mom, which I reference in the game and just generally
  love
  .
  This game was part of an undergrad thesis project that looked at the
  autobiographical representation of experiences of mental illness in games as a
  potentially therapeutic practice. This game was influenced by therapeutic
  exercises in journaling and narrative formation to aid in the processing of
  traumatic memory. The other game made for this project is Escort Yourself Out.

  Earth was abandoned ages ago during the red giant expansion. Now, dimly lit by
  the ghost light of a dead white dwarf, it lies layered with eons of forgotten
  civilizations. From the warmth of Martian reactor cities, scavengers hire
  illegal transportation to earth to delve into its depths, looking for ancient
  treasures. There they must deal with ghosts, machines and the strange life that
  has evolved on humankind's abandoned home planet.
  .
  In The Light Of A Ghost Star is a rules-lite system and setting for sci-fi
  roleplaying. It comes with a hex crawl and random tables that can also be used
  with other RPG systems.

game: In the Darkness (USA)

developer: Minakie
publisher: Minakie
genre: Role Playing
description:
  In the Darkness is a system-neutral one-page isekai adventure (for 3+ players)
  for role-playing games (RPGs), based on the classic "three-act scenario" model
  and designed to allow some versatility, depending on how much the Game Master
  (GM) wants to simplify it. If they wish to use only the most basic content
  available here, this adventure may last only for either a short one-shot or a
  couple of sessions mini-adventure, at most. If they wish to make use of the
  extra tips and options (and, perhaps, even complement them with extra content of
  their own), this can easily turn into a small campaign.
  .
  The Player Characters (who are just ordinary people) are in the subway, on their
  way to another absolutely banal day, until a series of surreal events trigger a
  fantastic adventure that leads them to an enigmatic forest populated by fairies
  and other bizarre creatures (such as flea-dogs). The goal is for them to find a
  way back into their own reality. In order to do that, they will require a key to
  unlock a magical gate. There are multiple keys, which means there are multiple
  ways the characters could get their hands on one. If they fail to get one of the
  keys, they can instead try to get one of the others.
  .
  The name of the adventure is purposely ambiguous, so as to leave the adventure
  theme a mystery, as there are certain elements of the adventure that should only
  be known to the Game Master, in order to surprise the players.
  .
  In the Darkness also has 40 dialogue cards to help any player whose character
  dies during the game and becomes a ghost. That way, if they don't know what to
  say and how to stay relevant to the adventure now that they're dead, they can
  always draw inspiration from the cards. Ghosts can either try to help or hinder
  the characters who are still alive.

  (presented by Francisco Duarte during the event Rolisboa 2019) and developed in
  collaboration with Cristina Lopes, David Neves, and Susana Mouro.

  In the Light of a Setting Sun: Saddlebag Edition is a compilation and expansion
  of the three original pamphlets released in the summer of 2019. Though a
  complete system within itself, the three original pamphlets were rudimentary and
  left a lot to be interpreted by the game's judge. Saddlebag Edition seeks to
  expand upon certain mechanics - while introducing others - in order to make the
  judge's role that much easier.
  .
  In the Light of a Setting Sun is a game of wild west adventure set between the
  years 1850 and 1900 upon the western frontier. Players will create and control a
  cowpoke eking out an existence on the open range, facing any obstacles and
  opponents sent their way by the game's judge. Through play cowpokes may grow to
  become larger-than-life figures, finding themselves in ever-escalating
  adventures and scenarios. What awaits them at the trail's end is left for the
  judge to decide.

  THIS IS IN VERY EARLY TESTING
  .
  due to technical difficulties further development is on hold until the Godot
  Engine 4 release
  .
  Sorry for having not updated in over years now, but my old codebase on the old
  engine version just was very exhausting to maintain, and given it's not
  something i can work on 9-to-5 i decided to just wait with the rewrite. This
  project is not canceled, just on hiatus for now.
  .
  Current state:
  .
  the demo is exactly the same as the full version (so don't buy it yet unless you
  want to give me free money).
  .
  there's only a few levels
  .
  the story isn't fleshed out yet
  .
  but i've already hidden an easter egg somewhere in the code, let's see if
  someone finds it
  .
  consider this a proof of concept / prototype release, more content will be
  added.
  .
  We have a Discord you can leave any feedback on, would be greatly appreciated.
  .
  Alternatively any issues can be reported on our Gitlab or via E-Mail.

  In 2014 I got Adrian heavily intoxicated and we recorded all the VO fairly ad-
  lib in one hit, feeding him different topics.
  .
  Radjor threw everything together, but then was this 2GB GIT conflict or
  something and I thought maybe people would think it's a commentary on this other
  FMV game that came around around the same time... the whole thing was forgotten
  about for a few years until I tweeted it out and then Jacob the other day was
  all like "lol the world needs to see this just put it on itch.io too"

  Each month will feature games by 10 different developers.  Each issue I hope to
  bring together games that explore the breadth of what our art form has to offer.
  .
  Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given,
  each contributor is paid and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.

  "In my country, history itself is edible.
  .
  Time masticated into tales,
  .
  people digested into stories.
  .
  Places leak mineral flavor.
  .
  Buildings are grated and ground.
  .
  Domes flattened into rotis, Blood boiled into dal.
  .
  The very earth on which we once grew,
  .
  is reabsorbed into the metabolism
  .
  of a nation that has decided to consume itself,
  .
  like an ouroboros.
  .
  A glorious violent meal.
  .
  A spectacular event.
  .
  A prelude to excreting people
  .
  who have been leached of all flavor and all difference.
  .
  The ideal members of a new state.
  .
  Excrement of the old."
  .
  - Mir UmarHassan 1960 (Translated 1983).
  .
  In 1960 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the
  Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of
  Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a
  clean border between the new states.
  .
  Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent
  erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem, where he wrote
  about the vapid consumption of a place and the excretion of a people devoid of
  the flavors of their individual and munificent past.
  .
  With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in
  Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of
  our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem.
  .
  The indifferent wonder of an edible place, is our attempt to ponder the violence
  of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of
  history.
  .
  Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester which is supported by Arts Council
  England. And a site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix,
  Leicester and at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago.
  .
  . . . . . . . . .
  .
  In The Indifferent Wonder Of An Edible Place, Studio Oleomingus manage to ask
  poignant questions about what it means to be a part of erasing history, and what
  can be done - if anything - to intervene. It is particularly heart-wrenching.

genre: Simulation
description:
  A toy ecosystem with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Will you tinker
  with DNA or sit back, relax, and see if life finds a way?
  .
  In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an
  evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control...
  .
  Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated
  genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and
  try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically
  modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is
  hard to undo your mistakes...
  .
  This is a game for people who don't want to be given all the answers. A game for
  people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch
  what happens.
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Fully modelled genetics and evolution
  .
  The behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics. How tall will a
  plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey?
  These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random
  mutations. Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical
  approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer.
  .
  Science to be Done
  .
  What do all those genes actually do? How is the world score calculated? What
  does world efficiency even mean? Much like a real scientist you will need to
  investigate, analyse and work with other players to try and answer these
  questions. To help you along the way the game outputs data in xml files so you
  can really get your science on.
  .
  Genetic Engineering
  .
  Create your own genetically modified organisms, but be careful, once a genome
  has entered your ecosystem it may be hard to undo the damage ... and are you
  sure you really know what those genes do yet?
  .
  Secrets to Discover
  .
  Who is employing you to create this ecosystem? Why are they doing it? Why are
  you doing it? What are those targets for? The answers to these any many other
  questions are out there, you just need to work together and find them...

  "All the time I'm having to make up stories. Because you are a friend, I can
  confess about it this way, but you know, if you'd interviewed me just like all
  the other interviews by people who are like, 'what is a transgender?' I would
  have had to lie."
  .
  Explanation
  .
  This is a series of works that came out of a residency carried out in early 2018
  in Tokyo, with the Creator Ikusei project, which is supported by the Japanese
  Agency for Cultural Affairs. I adopted research techniques from ethnography and
  history, such as open-ended interviews and participant observation, and
  developed a method of representing the results of this research in a playful and
  interactive form that draws heavily from familiar interaction design patterns
  such as the tamagotchi-style virtual pet and role-playing game multiple-choice
  dialogue systems.
  .
  Some of the development was funded by Making Ways, Sheffield City of Makers.
  .
  All of these pieces are made in Pico-8, a simulation of a 1980s computer that
  never actually existed..

  Installation: Interactive Portrait Cushions
  .
  In late 2018, an innovative new installation was created with funding from Arts
  Council England, using textiles by Anne Smithies and custom-made handheld
  consoles based on the Adafruit PiGRRL Zero. This creates an intimate space and a
  tactile engagement with the material, encouraging a sense of proximity to the
  material. The extensive use of textiles also encourages participation by people
  who might feel turned-off by the signifiers of videogames culture, creating a
  sense of a traditional domestic material culture colliding with avant-garde
  digital aesthetics.

  In the world of "video-games", interaction engineers have spent years rigidly
  defining the specialised and determinate ways that you, a "video-game"

  Except for The Button. The Button is not for you.

  Interactivity: The Interactive Experience is a short meta-narrative experience
  about how our interaction with game worlds is limited by convention, in equal
  parts of awkwardly-funny and oppressive. Explore the gallery in first-person,
  solve a handful of simple puzzles, and find a way to push The Button.
  .
  After several years, the gallery has been refurbished with new details,
  textures, tweaked puzzles, more endings, achievements and original music by
  Miles Tilmann. (The sound track is also available on Steam, along with an
  achievement enabled version of the game.) This new opening of the gallery has
  been described as The Stanley Parable meets Groundhog Day via David Lynch. The
  curator makes no such lofty claims, and advises you to stay behind the red
  cordon ropes at all times.

  your fleet?
  .
  Land your flagship on an alien world, allowing your crew to gather valuable
  resources for you- but be sure to equip them with powerful armor and weapons!

  trade or share valuable information with you, many more will attack on sight!

  Features
  .
  Tactical crew management. Direct crewmen to put out fires, or repair damaged
  equipment. Posting them to their station boosts your fleet's speed and combat
  abilities.

  ships each with their own crew.

  "We all live under capitalism, its power seems inescapable - but then, so did

  -Ursula K. Le Guin
  .
  INTO THE BLACK is a sci-fi roleplaying game where one or more players take on
  the role of Management and presents a futuristic universe of corporate
  oppression and class warfare, while others take on the role of Freelancers and
  create characters to struggle and survive in that universe. Players must
  navigate and explore a strange and wonderous galaxy while deeply indebted to an
  interstellar corporation. Life among the stars, then, is about treading the
  razor's edge of struggling for survival and finding joy and love where one can.
  .
  In this 160-page omnibus edition book, you'll find:
  .
  Six alien and humanoid species to choose from!
  .
  Rules for zero-level funnel character creation, to quickly generate disposable
  gig-economy corporate assets to grind beneath the wheels of necrocapitalism.
  .
  Rules to create and recruit your crew, to struggle to survive together in a
  vast, beautiful and uncaring galaxy.
  .
  A robust d20 + d6 conflict resolution system derived from Into the Odd.
  .
  Rules for creating and upgrading your spaceship; a requisite money-sink in order
  to eke out a meagre living.
  .
  A die-drop spatial mapping system to quickly and interestingly generate and
  populate entire subsectors of space.
  .
  Tables, charts and generators to create alien species, new worlds, strange
  cultures, ubiquitous corporate interests and other factions.
  .
  Reviews:
  .
  "The result is a homespun corner of space full of potential. An emergent story
  of local warlords or ancient tech can play out, or the group can soak in the
  emotional melange of finding a series of barren, if beautiful, landscapes while
  they watch the twin suns dance below several horizons."

description:
  Into the Flames is a roleplaying game about a haunted journey, specifically
  designed to be played in front of a campfire.
  .
  As a group you tell the story of a pilgrimage along an accursed road. Each
  player takes on the role of one of the pilgrims and over time uncovers their
  reasons for travelling - whether hoping to find treasure, escape persecution or
  experience religious epiphany.
  .
  Only one of the pilgrims will make it to the end of the road. The others will be
  picked off, one by one, by the spirits that follow your every step. They lurk at
  the edges of the flames, greedy for tribute.
  .
  Each night we will cast our offerings into the flames - a locket given by a
  former love, the sword that protects us, our meticulously kept diaries. We hope
  that what we offer is worthy. If not we will be culled, claimed into the ranks
  of the ghosts to haunt our former companions.
  .
  ***
  .
  Into the Flames is designed to be played over 1-3 hours without a GM. The 38
  page rulebook contains all of the instructions for play. It can be played as a
  LARP around a campfire or as a traditional roleplaying game, in-front of a fire
  or around a table of candles. The rules are designed to be read as a group, with
  a simple character generation to get you playing quickly.
  .
  Any payments over $12 also get you the trinket cards - an additional resource
  for the game. They are not necessary for play, but allow you to skip finding or
  bringing your own trinkets to offer to the flames.

publisher: Secret Foxfire
genre: Role Playing
description:
  As one goes further into the forest, the trees get taller, and it gets darker as
  their leaves block out more and more of the sun. There, too, it gets stranger
  and more dangerous. There are stories of what lies in the darkness of the deep
  forest: ancient ruins, crumbling and overgrown; terrible beasts unlike anything
  humanity has ever seen; villages of strange people who have never seen daylight;
  artifacts, lost relics, and more. There are those who grow tired of the peaceful
  tranquility of village life and attempt to explore the depths of the forest to
  see what is really there. Very few of them ever return.
  .
  Into the Forest is a tabletop game for 1-3 players. Using a standard six-sided
  die, a deck of 52 playing cards, this guide, and your imagination, you go on a
  journey to discover what lies in the depths of the forest - and try to make it
  back out alive. One play session takes approximately 30 minutes.
  .
  It takes place in a sci-fi world inspired and partially influenced by Caves of
  Qud as well as the writings of Ursula K. Leguin. The game was also influenced by
  the single-player TTRPG games Wretched Wasteland and The Artifact.
  .
  Accessibility is extremely important to Secret Foxfire and we've done our best
  to make sure everyone can enjoy the game. There are four PDF files available
  with your purchase. All contain the same information. The "simple print"
  versions are designed to be printed one-sided or simply read digitally on a
  screen. They should be compatible with screen readers for the visually impaired.
  The "booklet" versions are laid out for double-sided printing which can then be
  folded into a booklet. There are also "clean fonts" versions of both of these
  styles which use fonts which are more friendly to dyslexic readers. If Into the
  Forest is not accessible to you for any reason, or if you have any other
  feedback, please get in touch at secretfoxfire@gmail.com. We want everyone to be
  able to play and are committed to correcting any errors or oversights in the
  production of our games.

description:
  Tristram Rose appears to be a simple tailor, living and working in Inverness in
  Scotland in the mid-18th century, but then, he's an expert in keeping up
  appearances. In actuality, Tris is immortal, and has lived centuries moving from
  town to town in order to leave any suspicions behind him. He also has a
  remarkable ability: a healing touch which he similarly refrains from using, lest
  he be labelled a witch.
  .
  But when love comes knocking, it's hard to keep cautious. After revealing his
  powers to save the life of his partner Alasdair, Tris finds himself at risk of
  exposure - both as someone with supernatural gifts, and as a man who loves other
  men.
  .
  By noose or by carriage, Tris is leaving Inverness.
  .
  If he flees, Tris will lose everything and be left destitute on the streets, but
  if he stays to earn enough to start a new life, he risks the gallows.
  Fortunately, at that moment a woman in dubious clothes with an equally dubious
  background approaches him requesting an expensive commission.
  .
  Three paths lead forward. Should Tris try to mend his fractured relationship
  with Alasdair, seek help from his enigmatic client, or dive headlong into work
  to fund his escape?
  .
  Help him find his way through his last Inverness nights.
  .
  Over 65,000 words of queer, supernatural-historical fiction
  .
  Three distinct story pathways: prioritise your work, your relationship with
  Alasdair, or befriending your mysterious client
  .
  At least two endings to each path: will you run from your problems, get someone
  killed, or make amends?
  .
  Approximately 90 minutes per playthrough; playing all three paths is
  recommended, for at least 4 hours of gameplay
  .
  More than 20 lush illustrations showcasing the finest in 18th century fashion
  .
  Pastel colour scheme and authentic baroque soundtrack to soothe the dual
  stresses of sewing and exes
  .
  Content Warning: contains gore, sexual references, emotional/physical abuse,
  alcoholism, depictions of racism and homophobia, body horror, discussion of
  gender dysphoria, suicidality, implied suicide, description of dead bodies,
  institutional abuse/police brutality, and profanity. Recommended for ages 16+
  .
  Note: a large part of this game is about the institutional abuse of LGBTQI+
  people, how that abuse is amplified for LGBTQI+ people of colour, and the way it
  filters down into interpersonal abuse and fractured communities. While the
  final/'true' ending of the game is hopeful there are many difficult and
  confronting scenes throughout the story, as well as a number of bad endings.
  Please consider the above warnings carefully before playing.

  They spoke with sweet words.
  .
  They said "work hard enough, and you can have it all!"
  .
  They showed you images of the life you could lead. Wealth, family, comfort.
  .
  They dazzled the world with ideas of "The Dream," all while doing everything in
  their power to assure that they would have while everyone else has not.
  .
  The gods told stories, wove tales, captured hearts and minds. They built their
  power, their wealth, and they left everyone else in the dust. They still require
  the same sacrifices and devotion, but they ask time instead of blood. They ask
  attention rather than labor.
  .
  They want for nothing and still they want more.
  .
  Now is the time for all of that to change. Your community, your people will
  assert themselves, will bring down the gods. Their strongholds will fall and all
  they have claimed for their own will be given to those from whom it was stolen.
  .
  The Twilight of the Gods is upon the nine realms. Their fall will come at your
  hands.
  .
  A New Edda, Reforged
  .
  The gods have built their corporations on the backs and bones of humans and
  giants alike. Across the City, each of the realms groans under the weight of
  their rule. They keep most people placated with trinkets, ads, and a steady diet
  of games and other consumable media.
  .
  You are not most people.
  .
  You and those in your neighborhood know the time of the gods is over. You are
  going to be the cold winds of a neon Fimbulwinter that ushers out the old world
  and brings in the new.
  .
  In this game, you can play anyone, be anyone who is part of the fight against
  the gods. Begin play with one set of characters, change focus to a different
  group, and tell the story of taking down the gods from any angle you choose.
  This is a game about the whole of the people who will topple the gods.
  .
  The System
  .
  Iron Edda Reforged is powered by an all-new system designed by Tracy Barnett and
  playtested by Bee Zelda, Alex Flanigan, and Jeff Stormer. Characters are
  detailed, vibrant, and easy to make. The structure of play allows the players to
  change focus characters whenever they wish.
  .
  By moving perspectives from one group of characters to another, any group can
  tell the same kinds of stories that we see in other forms of media. Changing
  characters and perspectives allows for the telling of the story as a whole, not
  just the experience of a small group of people.
  .
  Characters are made by choosing a warrior clan and assigning three details,
  which are short, descriptive, true phrases. Each detail has a rating, excellent,
  good, or fair. When a character takes a risky action, the number of d6s they
  roll depends on the detail they're using. If they roll poorly, they can spend a
  control point to re-roll their misses. To get more control points, players can
  choose for their character to fail a roll, narrating the outcome.
  .
  Each warrior clan comes with a focus and a set of powers which can be used at-
  need, per scene, or per session. Jotunheim includes one set of powers for each
  of the ten warrior clans. Subsequent seasons will include different power sets
  that can be mixed and matched among seasons.
  .
  When a character runs into trouble, they get glitch dice that they have to
  include in their die pool when they take their next action.  When glitch dice
  hit, things go sideways for the character. Setbacks, advantages for the
  opposition, injury, or even death are all on the table if they're appropriate
  for the narrative.
  .

  Shot Network!

  Iron for the sword and hoe,

  Bone to bend and break in woe.

  These three things are true: iron, flax, and bone are you.

  - Mahar Abrera Mangahas
  .
  Iron, Flax, & Bone is a Pentolan hack on Grasswatch Games' excellent little
  pamphlet roleplaying game, AKSRS.
  .
  Iron, Flax, and Bone are the three characterstics Pentolans themselves use to
  describe innate qualities about each other:
  .
  In Pentola, iron is both rare and precious as it has apparent metamagical and
  demon-abjuring properties; any magic effects are more potent when iron is
  incorporated in the application and demons of all sorts shy away from iron as it
  ignores their abilities and defenses. Iron represents a character's force of
  will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.
  .
  Flax is a crop which represents so much of human ingenuity - one of the earliest
  and most widespread crops domesticated, flax supplies the Pentolans with food,
  oil, cloth, paper, and paint; it represents ingenuity, industry, trade, craft,
  and knowledge to the Pentolans. Flax represents a character's mental prowess and
  training, including their knowledge and intuition.
  .
  Pentolans are not strangers to danger or hard work and associate bone with both,
  priding themselves on their physical daring and the use of their bodies to
  accomplish their tasks, though they are ever mindful of their own ultimate
  fragility. Bone represents a character's physical prowess and training,
  including their strength, agility, hand-eye coordination, etc.
  .
  The rules in this zini are a lightweight alternative to the core Pentola rules,
  giving you a very lightweight take on playing in the setting.

developer: CannibalInteractive
publisher: CannibalInteractive
genre: Role Playing
description:
  'It's Six Random Characters and a Single Floor Dungeon, That's the Whole Game'
  is a first person dungeon crawler. You start with a team of 6 random characters,
  and try to make your way through a single labyrinth. Each character has a Class
  and Race that influence them at the start, and you can find things along the way
  to stay strong as you try and reach the exit. There are 105 classes and 28
  races, but only 4 races per class for a total of 420 characters (each race used
  15 times).
  .
  Some classes fill a similar niche, such as the Cleric, Healer, and High Priest
  all being Devotion-focused healing classes. They differ in their unique skills,
  such as the Cleric's passive that increases their Devotion stat as a battle goes
  on, the Healer's 'Simple Labor' skill that lets them weakly heal someone without
  using up their turn, or the High Priest's 'Desperation' skill that fully heals
  an ally while stunning themself.
  .
  Races range from the typical like Dwarves (+30% Hp, Armor; -30% Speed, Evasions)
  to the less common like the flashy Kitsune (+30% STR/AGI/LOG/DEV/SPD; three
  times as likely to be targeted by enemy attacks) to the unusual like Slimes
  (Regens 10% Hp & Mp each turn, +100% Speed, can acts twice each turn; cannot use
  any Equipment).
  .
  There are Toilets to scavenge equipment from, Computers to print out more Skill
  Licenses from, and Vending Machines to buy consumables from. There are also
  monsters, and a single door. Do your best to make it to the exit!
  .
  There is no persistent progress or saving; each run is its own thing. Once you
  beat the boss or all party members die, that's the end.
  .
  This is not a story-rich game or one where much information is given at all.
  This is not a roguelike where you can get a "God-run" and everything goes great.
  This is a game where you and your group is lost in a dungeon, and there is no
  one and nothing to save you but yourself.
  .
  While each dungeon is just one floor, it's expansive enough to make getting lost
  easy. A single run shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
  .
  The demo only has a single map and layout, but is otherwise the same experience.
  There's also a free Mac build, since I know some people play my games on Macs
  but since the Catalina update I can't guarantee it works on those operating
  systems.

  STORY
  .
  After countless years of careful space observation, the enormous telescope
  Chandra 17 suddenly locates a solar system quite similar to our own. As all
  earthly observatories turned their attention towards this new discovery, a
  signal of artificial origin is detected from deep within the system.
  .
  Reaction was immediate and a mission plan was conceived. No expense was spared
  in the construction of a massive space probe. It was designed and equipped to be
  ideally suited for the ultimate challenge: to meet and study extraterrestrial
  sentient life-forms. Equal care was taken with the crew. Only the most prominent
  scientists were selected and trained to ideally represent planet Earth.
  Everything was perfectly planned and success was certain. Yet somehow,
  everything has gone terribly wrong...
  .
  Now, imagine being jolted awake by an emergency alarm. As your surroundings come
  into focus, you realize you were deep in cryogenic sleep on a vast space probe.
  But why you are there is an elusive memory. Disoriented, you rush to the control
  room searching for answers. Once there you learn from the ship's AI that not
  only have you been asleep for decades, but you are also the last surviving
  member of the probe's crew.
  .
  To make matters worse, the probe is severely damaged by a disastrous impact with
  a passing meteoroid swarm. First, you must make repairs. Not only is your own
  survival at stake, but you need to find out what happened to the crew and why
  you alone survived.
  .
  Are You Prepared to
  .
  step into the spacesuit of Rachel Manners and find out why she was the sole
  survivor of this ill-fated expedition?
  .
  utilize an ingenious MOBOT - a mobile robot designed for planetary exploration
  to investigate this solar system and all its wonders?
  .
  solve the mystery of the mission's failure and locate the missing crew?
  .
  travel to six unique planets and uncover their secrets?
  .
  solve puzzles, gather clues and communicate with the most temperamental
  artificial intelligence ever designed?
  .
  Are you prepared for... J.U.L.I.A.
  .
  And there is more!

  You'll get a beautiful hintbook, soundtrack and one more game called J.U.L.I.A:
  Untold.

  The Jellicle Chance (co-written with Kit Pulliam) is an improv-heavy tabletop
  roleplaying game for four or more players (one of whom will run the game). You
  and a group of friends are sentient cats seeking the opportunity to achieve a
  sort of death ascension, after which the ascending cat will be reincarnated into
  a new form. Don't overanalyze it; this one's just about cats.
  .
  Everything you need to play the game is included except for one or more six-
  sided dice. This game has a heavy emphasis on creative expression, so if any
  members of your group are inclined to do so, outside props, equipment, or other
  game paraphernalia might be useful. The game is designed for a single session,
  but we certainly won't stop you if you decide to run this one as a sprawling,
  years-long campaign.
  .
  Two PDF files are included. One of them is a black and white version suitable
  for printing, and the other is a full color version featuring gold text on
  black. It is exquisitely gaudy, as all cats should be.

  STORY:
  .
  The year is 2182, it's been almost a decade since the Zeno Wars have

  ended, with the threat no more, civlizations all across the galaxy have

  humanoid animals living on what humans named, Earth "J", the home planet

  don't want her singing! Her tours being constantly ruined by some angry
  .
  people, Makoto got mad, so mad, she became a crimesweeper, going on a
  .
  personal vendetta against those who ruined her musical tours. This

  musical, is gonna be full of bullets.

  Jet Buster is a more accessible shoot-em'up compared to the previous

  Fight the Coronavirus during the Wuhan quarantine.
  .
  A game written during COVID-19 pandemic, telling a sad story of struggle,
  tenacity, and also hope with some bits of public inconsistencies too...
  .
  It is a tactical memory game, built as a documentary,  where you Follow Doctor
  Li, and relive the early days of the Coronavirus epidemic.
  .
  The outbreak from Huanan Seafood Market,
  .
  The courage of the quarantined population in Wuhan ("Wuhan, Jia You !"),
  .
  #IamNotAVirus and the surge of ordinary racism throughout the world
  .
  The "Diamond Princess"  confinment,
  .
  and more...
  .
  Contain and cure 5 different types of viruses, only with your memory and a
  little bit of strategy.
  .
  Don't hesitate to play, comment, share and follow us @JiayouMemoVirus !
  .
  What is coming next :
  .
  The story mode is pretty much complete. However, depending on the reception,
  more might come :
  .
  Custom levels
  .
  Bigger resolution
  .
  Smartphone and steam versions
  .
  The story behind the game :
  .
  The idea of the game emerged on the 2nd of January 2020, 10 days after the
  beginning of Wuhan quarantine.
  .
  We had been witnessing the early days of the epidemic unfolding, such as the
  quarantine, the prejudices against Chinese-looking associated with the
  #IamNotAVirus hashtag, the iconic death of Li Wenliang...  We realized that
  there was a story to be told.
  .
  But a few weeks later, we also experienced a kind of denial in our countries :
  "It is just a flu". There was a message to pass!
  .
  The first edition was published on the 11th of March, 5 days before French
  Confinement. But also 3 weeks too late to be of any use for prevention...
  However we still thought that the main message of encouragement "Jia you!" was
  more important than ever.
  .
  In the following weeks, we kept improving the game. And the 10th of May, the
  last day of our confinement, it was important to us to add a new  layer of
  narration through the achievements : retell our own experience of the
  confinement. With a 7-weeks shift, it creates a surprising symetry with Wuhan's.
  .
  As we publish this version, the 10th of June, players might be fed up with the
  Coronavirus and prefer to move on. But maybe that, in a few month or in a few
  years, it will be interesting, pleasant, or even salutary to come back  to
  relive those crazy months.
  .

  confront his own shortcomings, and brave the creeping nightmares of his
  subconscious.
  .
  Features:
  .
  -Full-length Japanese-style RPG.
  .
  -Classic turn-based combat with some modern sensibilities.
  .
  -A big emphasis on exploration.
  .

  stats and new abilities.

  -A story for adults delivered from the perspective of a child.
  .
  -Jokes.

  Just Another Day at the Office is a light-hearted action game with musings on
  the meaning of work. You play the role of a disgruntled office worker. Years and

  paperwork. You feel your mind slowly dying. What are you doing it all for? Is
  this all there is to life?
  .
  And suddenly you snap. This is not how it's going to end.
  .
  And that's how it starts...
  .
  Let loose, you try to escape from the office, using whatever weapons you find -
  which means constructing Molotov cocktails from whiskey bottles and robbing the
  art department of their spray cans for some redecorating. Along the way you'll
  get confronted by police, bankers, and finally maybe even save the world - or
  fail miserably?
  .
  You can even take a break from the action to watch the people in the world talk
  or think, and read a few books.

  Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy is 16-bit styled RPG featuring turn-based
  combat, plenty of exploration, and a funky soundtrack to pump you up. This is an
  officially licensed game based on the live-action monster wrestling group Kaiju
  Big Battel, who have been performing their Godzilla-meets-WWE act for over 20
  years.
  .
  Designed for Kaiju fans and newcomers alike, Fighto Fantasy takes players on a
  quest across time and space as they work to undo damage caused by the evil Dr.
  Cube as he rampages through history in search of fame and glory. With seven main
  playable heroes (and a secret one to unlock), players explore six time periods
  and punch out dozens of deadly monsters.
  .
  All the world is watching as the Kaiju Big Battel Title Fight is about to begin:
  The diabolical Dr. Cube vs. the patriotic pugilist, American Beetle! Things take
  a sudden turn when Cube pulls out a secret weapon that rips open portals into
  history. Now it's up to the Kaiju Heroes to pursue Cube across the centuries,
  from Egypt to Rome to Russia and beyond! Is the mad doctor pursuing dangerous
  artifacts lost to time, or does he just want to deface famous landmarks with his
  own ugly mug?
  .
  Combat: No random encounters here; touch enemy NPCs on the map to trigger turn-
  based battles. Each of the seven main heroes has their own strengths and
  weaknesses.
  .
  Side stories: When you're not chasing Dr. Cube through time, take a minute to
  help out some locals. Slay a musclebound mummy, rescue lost Kaiju heroes, adopt
  cats!
  .
  Map abilities: Each hero has a unique ability to interact with environmental
  objects, unlocking hidden paths and secret treasures.
  .
  Difficulty selection: Easy Mode for a relaxed experience, Normal Mode for
  players who want some tense fights, and Hard Mode for players looking for more
  deadly dangers.
  .
  12+ hours of RPG adventure.
  .

  Can you survive in the city of Trenn?
  .
  In this fantasy themed, turn-based city simulation game, players will need to
  use their wits to see it through to the end! Your citizens will look to your
  leadership when successful, or they may abandon the town when you make massive
  mistakes. The choice is yours.
  .
  Your main objective: to build a prosperous town. To achieve this, you must
  recruit villagers and create a thriving city as you contend with world events
  like monster attacks and refugees, market upswings (or recessions), and trade
  deals with neighboring towns. Choose from various businesses
  .
  such as: hotels, stables, and weapon makers! Each of these contributes a
  different purpose to Trenn and over time: will help you grow your empire.
  .
  Kalling Kingdom incorporates a simulated marketplace for players to take
  advantage of. Understanding just the right time to invest and sell could
  drastically alter the events to come. Organization, a keen eye, and a little
  risk could lead to big results when it comes to funding your town.
  .
  Do you have what it takes to lead?
  .
  Multiple types of businesses to build
  .
  Marketplace to manage
  .
  Defend your town against monsters
  .
  Recruit villagers of all types to grow your numbers
  .
  Decide on risky moral dilemmas

description:
  You are a coat full of rats living in a modern society, trying to pass as human.

  If you want to keep living the life you've come to appreciate, you best not let

  .
  Keep It Together is a simple game about learning how to interact with different
  people, social anxiety, and trying to stay composed under stress. Talk to people
  and try not to say things that upset them, because a bad response will stress
  you out - too much stress and you'll be playing finger twister on your keyboard

  About this Game
  .
  "Keeping the Lights on is a GM-less game about a synagogue, and its surrounding
  community fighting to keep it running, trying not to burn out in the process.
  .
  It is a collaborative story game about a tight-knit community, and how its
  members act when times are hard. It's about burnout, and how to deal with it
  when it happens. But this is also a game about light, unity, charity, and hope.
  .
  You play as four members of a soon-to-be closed synagogue, during Hanukkah in
  the year 2019 (5780 in the Jewish calendar). You, along with the other members,
  are fighting to keep it running, but all the discussion, arguing, and organizing
  takes a toll on your health. You must keep your spirits up, while dealing with
  life on the side.
  .
  This game endeavours to give you a well-rounded experience where you can explore
  difficult feelings in a safe environment. At the same time, this game can offer
  a way out of the hardship that it deals you, or at least make the idea of facing
  that hardship by yourself less scary"
  .
  You'll get a 13-page rpg for 4 players that tackles difficult subject matters
  with maturity and respect. The game uses a dreidel and matches as its main
  tools, and you will use them to play a story of saving your synagogue and
  yourselves.
  .
  A review
  .
  Brent Jans (@DorklordCanada) reviewed the game for his video series,
  #ReadIndieRPGs, saying:
  .
  ...I really do like games that can show us how to act, can model good behavior,
  can model best practices so that we can then take that into our own lives, and
  use those skills . I love roleplaying games that do that, and I think 'Keeping
  the Lights On' is a perfect example of that type of game.
  .
  You can find the video here.

developer: Seraaron
publisher: Seraaron
genre: Role Playing
description:
  The Prophesy:
  .
  The Sea, King Llyr, has died. His family gather in the great hall to hear his
  will be known, spoken by his spouse and steward, Penarddun. It is as many
  suspected, and as a few feared: All the lands of Prydein, its mountains and
  sheep, all its farmers and guardsmen, and all the powers of statehood are to be
  inherited solely by the King's youngest born - the teenaged princeling Branwen -
  rather than being divided equally...
  .
  The reason for this sudden change in tradition? Branwen was prophesied to become
  the next King by his witch-child Manawydan, when they said:
  .
  One born of flame and soot:
  .
  Who will befriend the Fair-Hound in the moonlit valley,
  .
  And will come of age upon the night of their Father's natural passing,
  .
  And thus, before daybreak, will inherit all the world of Men?
  .
  So now each Lordling must choose: Will you follow your father's wishes and swear
  fealty to Branwen, or revolt and fight against the tide of destiny and take what
  you think is rightfully yours, or perhaps you will find another way?
  .
  The game at a glance:
  .
  A print-n'-play roleplaying game about a family of giants, their feuds, and a
  prophesy that may spell doom.
  .
  Inspired by Welsh mythology! Play as characters from the Mabinogion.
  .
  Each player needs only a handful of six-sided dice  (D6s), a pencil, a good
  sense of wonderment, and a print-out of their character sheet.
  .
  Not inherently built as a 'player vs. player' type game, but ending everything
  in a duel or starting a civil war are definitely some possible outcomes of the
  scenario.
  .
  It can be played multiple times, and each time may be different.
  .
  The system uses pool-based success counting, and draws on factors from different
  sources to adjust difficulty. (See screenshots, right / below).
  .
  Licensed under CC BY-SA, if you want to hack it.
  .
  The Cast:
  .
  Fran: Gallant but Austere. A great warrior and poet. Feels robbed by the
  unorthodox changes made by the prophesy, and wants the will to be rescinded.
  Thinks Manawydan is a fraud. Has never trusted Dormadd.
  .
  Manawydan: Apprehensive but Excited. Wants their fortune to come true
  peacefully. Doesn't have total control over their magic. Wants the best for the
  family, but has had some conflicts with them over the years.
  .
  Nisyn: Calm and Inquisitive. Will follow the prophesy only if it's true, but
  wonders about its legitimacy and the timing of Manawydan's claims. Wants
  answers. Offers advice to Branwen, but only to serve their own interests.
  .
  Efnisyn: Brash and Ambitious. A bit of a trickster. Wants to be King instead of
  Branwen, and will try anything to prove they are worthy. Thinks they may be able
  to twist Manawydan's words to their favour.
  .
  Branwen: Kindhearted, but a bit Nave. Saddened by the death of the King, and a
  little unsure about taking on this burden, but wants to make him proud. Doesn't
  like all the sudden attention, though. Keeps Dormadd close.
  .
  Dormadd: Resembling of a handsome wolf at first, but perhaps a little rounder.
  Truly, the best of dogs. Believes they were sent by the Silver Wheel to protect
  the prophesied King with their life, should it come to that.
  .
  Explore Celtic Myths & Folklore:
  .
  The game is set in the glass hall of the  Castle of the Winds, which floats in
  the cliffs  above Dinas Olai, the city of light, the capital  of Prydein, in the
  misty mountains of Eryri.
  .
  These names and places are all inspired by stories from the Mabinogi and the
  Triads, in a place  and a time before these fair lands were  touched by Roman
  hands. Familiarity with  bronze-age history or Brythonic folklore is not
  required to play though. If you're more  familiar with Norse Mythology, then
  you're  part-way on the right track. The names are  different, but the context
  is similar.
  .
  A full pronunciation guide and a family tree of the celtic gods are also
  provided!
  .
  An Improvisational Roleplaying Game (For 3-7 Players):
  .
  This is a 25 page demo scenario for a bigger game called AGORA (not yet
  released). It can be played in 3-4 hours, or continued over several sessions.
  Familiarity with the full rules is not required to play.

  Kingdom Two Crowns is a side-scrolling micro strategy game with a minimalist
  feel wrapped in a beautiful, modern pixel art aesthetic. Play the role of a
  monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and
  protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown.
  .
  In the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that
  stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the
  environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep.
  .
  But you don't have to rule alone! Introducing a cooperative play experience that
  is totally unique to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a
  classic solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together
  locally, dropping in or out at will.
  .
  In addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also
  includes:
  .
  Dead Lands
  .
  Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the
  Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG
  Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead
  mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from
  Bloodstained the mythic demon horse "Gaming" with its powerful charge attack.
  Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!
  .
  Shogun
  .
  Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play
  as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead
  your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as
  you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.
  .
  A challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a
  long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall
  reign stronger than one!
  .

  The Western States have entered an age of wonders. Technological innovations

  But these new wonders have not brought blessings to everyone. With the Federal
  Government in the pocket of powerful Robber Barons and Vampires; the poor, and
  the land itself, are dispossessed and exploited. In The Western States, many
  stow away on the freight trains in search of paying work.

  Werewolves prowl the Northern Prairie. Big Foots leave the woods in greater
  numbers. The dirt itself seems to have risen up in the Dust Bowl of the Southern

  enter, but the people need your help. And righteousness is its own reward.

  Features
  .
  The house changes based on the things you know. You just learned that the dark
  hallway has one more door in it and a vengeful ghost is coming after you? There
  is now.

  The game is an unconventional horror game perceived from the first perspective.
  There is no combat - all the monsters must be dealt with indirect means, either
  by avoiding, hiding or something cleverer.

  The ghosts lurking in the dark corners of the house work
  .
  in different ways. Some are hostile, some or not, but only one thing is clear:
  they will not make your journey to the source of the madness any easier.

  In order to solve the secrets of the house, you need to figure out how the house
  works. Is one specific bookshelf in your way and need it to disappear? Read a
  note that contradicts its existence.

  You begin your time inside the hallucination as something formless, with very
  little defining your identity. As you face trials (each trial based on a song
  from E*MO*TION) you and your partner create and discover what makes up your
  identity. Only once you have finished your trials can you finally be free.
  .
  This game was made for the Carly Rae Jepcember jam.

  If you have a good time playing or just reading this game I would appreciate it
  a lot if you left a rating/review or let me know on twitter!
  .
  UPDATE: Now includes "LA Hallucination: Side B", an expansion that adds more
  trials based on songs from E*MO*TION: Side B and a new ending. The new trials
  are messier and more self-indulgent than those in the base game and are less
  focused on the setting of LA. It's more focused on developing the hallucination
  as a setting/character while still keeping the relationship between player
  characters as the main focus. If that sounds interesting to you, that's great!
  There are instructions for how to use the expansion in the PDF. If it doesn't
  sound interesting to you, you can ignore it and just play the base game. Either
  way I hope you enjoy your time with the hallucination.

  enhancing Treasure cards. Players can then use these Treasures to perform great
  Feats such as slaying fearsome giants (or are they windmills?) and dueling their
  rivals. The player who has performed the most Feats by the end of the game is
  the winner!

developer: CannibalInteractive
publisher: CannibalInteractive
genre: Horror;Exploration
description:
  This is not a horror game about things that jump out and scare you. This is a
  horror game about feeling lost and being worried about dying instantly to what's
  around the next corner.
  .
  This game does not care about what came before or what comes after. There is
  only the labyrinth.
  .
  This game has enemies that you cannot beat, only outrun. They are slow, they
  aren't smart, but they are patient, they are many, and they are powerful. Some
  will be very obvious with their presence, and some will blend in almost
  perfectly with their surroundings. Make sure to save when you have breathing
  room.
  .
  Note: There is an ongoing bounty where the first person to have video evidence
  that they've beaten this game will get every public project I have made and will
  make for free. I must emphasize that you should not feel bad for trying and
  failing, as this game (and most of my other games) is meant to be a test against
  the hubris of humanity. The bounty has been claimed, but best of luck to those
  who still challenge the maze! Now that it's been claimed, I've brought back the
  "no monsters" version for those who'd prefer to climb without worry.
  .
  [Side note: this game engine (Smile Game Builder) is not very flexible so just
  ignore most of the menu (assessed through the Esc key) and use it only to save
  your progress. Also, during my first test my antivirus forced it closed to scan
  it, so if it does that just the once for you please don't send bug reports about
  that; it's pretty out of my hands. Also, there is no soundtrack; I was listening
  to this playlist during most of development and I recommend it.]

publisher: Massif Press
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Lancer imagines a future where a survivor humanity has spread to the stars after
  weathering terrible ecological collapse on Earth - the end of the Anthropocene
  as a consequence of unrestrained consumption and poor stewardship. Thousands of
  years later, humanity lives in the wake of a desperate revolution, one where the
  victorious radicals now manage the galaxy they've won.
  .
  The setting features a mix of gritty, mud-and-lasers military science fiction
  and mythic science fantasy, where  conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces,
  mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpro-state agents, and
  relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking, unknowable
  beings. Lancer's galaxy is one where utopia exists, but is under threat, and the
  struggle is not yet entirely won; the revolution is not yet done.
  .
  In Lancer, players adopt the roles of mechanized chassis pilots - mech pilots -
  comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Some groups will fight to
  rectify the crimes of previous administrations; others will fight for their
  nation,  pieces in a greater game of hegemony. Others will carry the banner of a
  corpro-state or mercenary company, working to advance private interests while
  lining their pockets. Others still will fight for groups acting in opposition to
  those in power - for the underground, for the forgotten, agents of entropy and
  agents of yet more radical revolutions.
  .
  Lancer offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player
  backgrounds and hooks to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room
  for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It's best with a group of 3-5
  players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign.
  .

  Included with the PDF of the Lancer Core Book are the following:

  Essentially limitless amounts of possible gear combinations to outfit your

developer: Dual Wield Software
publisher: Dual Wield Software
genre: Card Game;Action;Role Playing;Strategy
description:
  The Land of Glass is a card game with a twist: speed. It's CCG meets action RPG,
  combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your
  heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.
  .
  A Real-Time Card Game
  .
  The Land of Glass is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back
  and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy
  of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The
  monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.
  .
  Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your
  foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady
  stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice,
  explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents
  down for some needed breathing room.
  .
  Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the
  playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning
  storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find,
  and experimenting is key to survival.
  .
  A Character-Driven Story
  .
  A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended
  the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge.
  .
  The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed
  to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin.
  Instead, they brought monsters.
  .
  The Land of Glass is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns.
  Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront
  his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that
  threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, The
  Land of Glass tells stories that are both personal and small-it is a character
  study first and an epic fantasy second.
  .
  Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.
  .

  The last of humanity are fleeing across space, pursued by the implacable inhuman
  adversary that destroyed their civilisation. They're outnumbered and outgunned.
  Supplies are running low. The actions of a brave few could be all that stands
  between humanity and extinction.
  .
  Welcome to the Last Fleet.
  .
  Last Fleet is a PBTA tabletop roleplaying game where you play brave pilots,
  officers, engineers, politicians and journalists struggling to hold the human
  race - and themselves - together under unbelievable pressure. The game focuses
  on action, intrigue and drama in this high-stakes situation. You'll fight space
  battles, search for enemy infiltrators, tackle supply shortages and navigate
  faction politics. You'll strive against your own self-doubt and sometimes crack
  under the stress.
  .
  The game provides support to create your own evocative setting, or you can play
  out of the box as the survivors of the Interplanetary Commonwealth. This
  fractious alliance of planets was wiped out by the Corax - an extradimensional
  fungus network that dwells in the tenebrium, the same medium that FTL ships
  travel through. The Corax attack through spatial rifts, launching spore ships to
  harry the fleet. Victims are paralysed and have their genetic and neural
  patterns harvested: everything you know, the Corax now know. And worse, your
  former friends may see you again, reincarnated as a Corax avatar.

  delivered a satisfying and crunchy deep dive into the action, emotion, and
  escalating paranoia that make up the life of a Rag-Tag (space) Fugitive on the

  prospective CAGs, politicians, and shady operators."

  implacable enemy--really fueled not just every action scene, but, especially,
  the interpersonal scenes as our characters reached out, broke down, let loose,
  and tried to maintain their humanity at the edge of annihilation."
  .
  -Zach Bain, playtester
  .
  "The beauty of Last Fleet is that you're going to want to put your characters
  under pressure -- the roleplaying that spins out is just so juicy. It's
  extremely clever, extremely fun design."
  .
  -Nick Bate, playtester
  .
  "Black Armada is part of a new generation of PbtA designers who are tackling new
  concepts in new genres with new ideas. Last Fleet is aimed at replicating some
  of my favorite fiction, and I'm excited to see Josh exploring concepts of
  authority, tension, and political pressure through that lens. I can't wait to
  see the finished game!"
  .
  -Mark Diaz Truman, Magpie Games
  .
  Join the Fleet
  .
  The playbooks each represent a particular personality, approach or set of issues
  you want to explore. There are twelve:
  .
  Aries, a hot-headed character who rushes in where angels fear to tread, and is
  unafraid to speak their mind.
  .
  Taurus, a tough, selfless and principled character who does what's needed no
  matter how much punishment is thrown at them.
  .
  Gemini, a charismatic communicator who pursues their own agenda that might not
  be completely in line with the fleet's interests.
  .
  Cancer, an experienced leader who cares deeply for their comrades, but may be a
  little too willing to overlook their problems.
  .
  Leo, a magnetic individual who people want to follow. Where will they lead them?
  .
  Virgo, a serious professional who prides themselves on being the best, but may
  put themselves under too much pressure at time.
  .
  Libra, a skilled diplomat and negotiator who may be looked to for leadership.
  .
  Scorpio, a secretive manipulator whose motives are in doubt - including by
  themselves.
  .
  Sagittarius, a relentlessly curious person who might be an explorer, engineer or
  spy, or perhaps all three.
  .
  Capricorn, an uncompromising tactician who is willing to take risks to defeat
  the enemy. Will they take things too far?
  .
  Aquarius, a perceptive investigator who does not shrink from confronting the
  truth, no matter how painful it might be.
  .
  Pisces, an otherworldly person with strange abilities that allow them to see
  things others do not.
  .
  In addition to your playbook, you can choose a role within the fleet. You can
  play a military officer, pilot or marine, engineer or scientist, journalist or
  civilian leader. Each comes with its own special move.
  .
  PBTA
  .
  Last Fleet is based on the excellent Powered by the Apocalypse framework
  pioneered by Apocalypse World. In this case, that means it uses a simple 2d6
  based system, with  prompts for interesting, dramatic outcomes from every roll;
  characters are organised into playbooks that provide everything you need on a
  single piece of paper; and GM advice is codified into clear principles that tell
  you not just how the mechanics work but how to get the best from the game.
  .
  Under Pressure
  .
  The game's mechanics push forward the central theme of pressure: pressure on
  your characters, pressure on the fleet, pressure on humanity. You can win almost
  any conflict if you're willing to pay the consequences, by racking up more
  pressure on your character that ultimately pushes them to Breaking Point. That's
  when your character goes off the rails, lashing out at their friends or hurling
  themselves into certain doom.
  .
  The only way to keep the pressure under control is by indulging your vices and
  risking losing control, or by building relationships that matter with other
  characters. Neither route is risk-free. When you're not putting your life on the
  line, you're putting your heart on the line.

game: Last Knight - Rogue Rider Edition (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/L/Last Knight - Rogue Rider Edition (USA)/Last Knight - Rogue Rider Edition (USA).json
developer: Toco Games
publisher: Toco Games
genre: Action;Adventure;Platformer
description:
  Last Knight is over-the-top non-stop jousting action in a beautiful brutal
  fantasy world! It comes with bucketloads of content and is inspired by
  outstanding third-person platformers like Crash Bandicoot. It uses the Unreal
  Engine to bring it all to live...
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  OVER-THE-TOP JOUSTING! - Countless enemies had been shot, hacked and slashed in
  the history of games. Now it is time to ram a wooden lance in some gut, send
  your foes flying, and watch them bite the dust! Body parts ripping off, ragdoll
  horse physics, and destructive environments included.
  .
  A BEAUTIFUL BRUTAL WORLD - Dive into a magical fantasy world full of treasures
  and adventures! Don't be fooled by the cartoony looks: here, simply bumping into
  a silly wooden fence spells a sudden end to your hero's life. If you fancy dying
  in a more heroic way, how about getting swallowed by a giant toad, falling into
  a lava pit, exploding from eating too much turkey, getting impaled by a Hitler
  Snowman, or just getting lit on fire by a dragon!
  .
  BUCKETLOADS OF CONTENT - Divided into three major parts - the Story Mode, the
  Endless Journey Mode and the Rogue Rider Mode - this game has a lot to offer and
  there is always something new to accomplish, find, or unlock. Power-ups,
  characters, view modes, mutators, quests, game mode variations, randomly
  generated hats, you name it! Did you ever wish to be a skeleton king with a
  fancy wig riding over rainbows on a flower-pooping pink unicorn? It's all up to
  you in this game!
  .
  INSPIRED BY CRASH BANDICOOT - Good third-person platformers were always hard to
  find on PC, when consoles sport countless shining examples: the first Crash
  Bandicoot titles, Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, and Super Mario were all a big
  inspiration for Last Knight. This game kicks it up a notch with non-stop
  jousting action, no-health instant death, procedurally-generated worlds, as well
  as custom-crafted levels with Knightmare levels in-between. To top it off, the
  new Rogue Rider Mode pushes it all into a rogue-like direction, and if you don't
  like third-person view, try playing in first-person mode!

  throughout Rosarah. Each is riddled with dangerous traps, and puzzles that seek
  to trick any who might enter uninvited. If you are able to navigate them, each
  contains a powerful spell to add to your set of abilities.
  .
  Battle Enemies: Take on fourteen powerful bosses, as well as minibosses, and a
  host of fiendish foes determined to reign destruction across Rosarah. Use many
  different strategies to fight, making use of an arsenal of weapons and magical
  attacks. Find new abilities, and upgrade your abilities by finding hidden
  treasures.
  .
  Legend Quest: For those looking for an extra challenge, Legend Quest is included
  in v5.0.0. With this game mode, the entirety of Rosarah is changed. Enemies are
  stronger and have new abilities. The overworld includes new perilous foes and
  traps. Every Library has a transformed layout and new mechanics, requiring you
  to use every tool at your disposal.

  Leggite Luta Livre is an arcade beat-em-up for the Nintendo Entertainment
  System.
  .
  Story
  .
  One hundred solar cycles have passed since the three-front revolution on Irata
  that overturned settler rule and led to a new era of peace and prosperity for
  all the native creatures of the planet.
  .
  In this time, some of the former colonists who remained on Irata have settled
  down. The Leggites developed martial arts and now live in peace with the local
  fauna. But the spheroids have turned to organized crime.
  .
  Their boss, Chunga, uses violent thugs to control his territory and keep a boot
  on the neck of the local population. Chunga thought he was untouchable. And he
  might have been.
  .
  But then he decided to mess with Leggette and her family.
  .
  This game features five missions. Players have a dynamic set of moves that
  include a standard kick, a jump kick, and a roll maneuver that can be combined
  in unique ways to create engaging combat encounters. Players can also pick up
  two projectile items that further extend combat choices.
  .
  There are nine unique boss battles, multiple enemy types, and an entire alien
  world to explore and liberate. You are Leggette. Your child has been kidnapped
  by an evil mob boss. It's time to clean up the streets of Irata.

  Leggite Luta Livre is the fourth game in the MULEniverse series, which
  narratively extends the work of Danielle Bunten Berry's MULE economic simulator
  game.

  FOR THE BEST EXPERIENCE: I recommend getting an original NES controller and a
  USB adapter for it. You can find one here or here. You can also use any gamepad
  for a similar experience.
  .
  For really enterprising types, this game is fully playable on an actual NES. You
  can use either an Everdrive, a PowerPak, or flash an empty cart, as long as each
  has mapper 30 support.
  .
  * * *
  .
  Leggite Luta Livre was made possible thanks to NESMaker, an engine developed to
  make NES development more accessible.
  .
  In order to play Leggite Luta Livre, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend
  FCEUX. Many emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper
  NESMaker uses for its games.
  .
  Once you have FCEUX downloaded, start it up and open the
  Leggite_Luta_Livre_Demo.nes ROM. The game should work fine.
  .
  FOR MAC USERS: Download OpenEMU for Mac. When you open the program, right click
  on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select "Default
  Core." Then select FCEU.

  About The Music
  .
  In 2019, I decided to create one song per month. While mostly electronic, it
  contains instruments such as grand piano, acoustic guitar, vocals, with several
  additions by guest musicians (cello, violin, trumpet, e-bass, and many more).
  Most songs can probably be categorized as chill/downtempo, and revolve around
  dark/depressing themes, with a few rays of hope every now and then.

description:
  There's a strange comfort to ambiguity. To stand at the threshold between states
  of what was and what's next, to inhabit the places of transition. But you're
  never truly alone here. There are things that hunger within the dark places.
  Strange creatures and mysteries lie in wait and tumbling into the wrong place at
  the wrong time may put you on the path towards doom.
  .
  Grab your flashlights and blood splattered jackets as you try to make it through
  the night. Beware, snapping bone and rending flesh are often the simplest
  outcome. While there may be great power within these places... not all mysteries
  can be solved and not everyone can be saved. Above all, there are fates far
  worse than death.

  ______________________________________________

  LIMINAL HORROR is a rules-lite, adaptable Survival-Horror roleplaying game about
  normal characters and their struggles against the things that go bump in the

  blending simple, old-school inspired rules with modern, narrative first
  principles. Survival is not guaranteed and those that do make it through the
  night are often forever changed.

  The Investigator edition has everything you need to bring modern horror to your
  ttrpg table. It acts as a players guide and Facilitator rules reference enabling
  you to run your own adventures, any of the official modules, or the hundreds of

  Lingotopia is a language learning game about being lost in a city where you
  don't speak the language. Learn Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian,
  Spanish and more! You play a little girl shipwrecked on the shores of a strange
  island. In order to get back home you'll need to explore the island and talk to
  its inhabitants. Sadly, no one speaks your language! You'll have to learn words
  one at a time to decipher what these strange creatures are saying.
  .
  How does it work?
  .
  Explore a lovingly handcrafted city.
  .
  Click on objects in the environment and your guide will teach you the word for
  them.
  .
  Learn words by talking to the city's inhabitants.
  .
  Voice recordings by native speakers teach you the correct pronunciation.
  .
  Learning a language with a different script? Toggle between the romanised and
  native script at any time.
  .
  Words you know can be translated when they appear during conversations. So, the
  more words you know, the more you'll begin to feel at home in this strange
  place. You might even be able to find a way off the island!
  .
  Will this really help me learn a language
  .
  Yes! Learning words is the most important part of language learning. You can
  learn several hundred words by playing Lingotopia. As the game only translates
  individual words and not entire sentences, you also learn word order and grammar
  by playing. All dialogue in the game is tied to the setting and story, so you
  have a reason to decipher each and every sentence.
  .
  What languages can I learn?
  .
  The official languages are Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian,
  Spanish. You can learn English in each of these languages. There are also over
  20 "unofficial languages", these don't have voice recordings and I won't be able
  to vouch for the accuracy of the translations. I will keep an up to date list of
  the included unofficial languages at https://www.lingoludo.com/lingotopia/.
  .
  Enjoy the game!

  It'll be good to get the year behind us, don't you think?
  .
  Ah, sorry, I'm just rambling. We're almost there.

  little boats of farewell is a 10-minute point-and-click adventure about bidding
  farewell to things you want to leave behind. Stroll along the River of Goodbyes,
  where people from all over come to release boats carrying their farewells.

  Think about what you want to say goodbye to this year and let your own boat
  drift down the river.
  .
  In little boats of farewell, there is the option to share a memory of your visit
  to the river with others who visit the river themselves. Please note that while
  your physical presence along with your boat is shared, what you bid farewell to
  is not.
  .
  There is also a printable card version of the boat if you would like to
  physically write down what you want to bid farewell to. Please download the zip
  file for the print template and printing instructions.

  .
  Simple Controls, Complex Gameplay:
  .
  Nyah can walk on the ground and collect treasures while her light can fly in any
  direction - you control them both at the same time. Forming a telekinetic beam
  between them, you'll create a powerful connection that can swing Nyah to new
  heights, destroy barriers, thwart spirits and light the way to secret locations.
  Your coordination with these two characters is key, as disembodied spirits can
  appear without warning and hurt Nyah or her light. You'll learn their unique
  play style intuitively and quickly as fresh challenges emerge to test you in the
  wilderness.
  .
  Discover Dozens of Unique Items
  .
  Collect dozens of unique treasures in Nyah's lunchbox that reveal memories from
  Nyah's past and rearrange them however you like. Decide which items to keep with
  you on your journey and which to offer to the mysterious spirit cat Roadkill,
  who can unlock secret challenge levels with special items.

  How's it going? My name is Belle, but I go by Amaiguri basically everywhere
  online. I make adoraBELLE things to touch people's hearts! I'm a college student

  and its world in my spare time all by myself, more or less, but I'm not very
  good at programming... You should follow me on Instagram and get to know me
  more. If you have any questions or comments about this scrappy little

  A Faction-building TTRPG about Politics, Betrayal, and Friendship!
  .
  Little World of Fates (LWOF) is a TTRPG about the building and maintaining of
  factions and influence in Yssaia, the universe of Little Burned Maiden and the
  larger World of Fates universe. Shortly after the consolidation of the greatest
  empire the world has ever seen, players will take on the roles of members and
  leaders of a newly rising faction within the world. However, the peace is
  tentative at best - many Northerners still hail the reawakened Emperor of
  Thuille, Demons have begun appearing throughout the world, and more people have
  been touched by the Abyss than ever. So, take your fate into your own hands in
  the World of Fates Official TTRPG!
  .
  Play as Heroes, Kings, Rebel Leaders, and More!
  .
  Player Characters will take the role of Leaders and - with the moderation and
  adjudication of a Game Master (GM) - form Factions, gather Followers, and spread
  their Influence over the whole world. Will your Faction rise to power or break
  apart in the pressures of an everchanging world?
  .
  Freeform Classless Character Development
  .
  There are no classes in the LWOF TTRPG: Instead, build YOUR character to be who
  YOU want with the collection of 100+ Feats and Limitations. Your faction Leader
  can have any number of abilities or disabilities, be any gender, have any
  sexuality, and any appearance!
  .
  Political Meetings, Masquerade Balls, Investigations, and Trials
  .
  Some TTRPGS are about battles, wars, or heists - LWOF is at its best as a
  political fantasy! Pull a knife from your ballgown and point it at the throat of
  the handsome prince from another realm. Win the patent war on your luxury cheese
  at trial. Trace rumors of illicit abalone trade in the West. What tactics will
  your Faction use to gain Influence?
  .
  A Diverse World Full of Stories to Explore!
  .
  The World of Fates is a world shaped by the stories of its heroes - the stories
  that its people tell itself.  Will you work to solidify the peace or work
  against it? What stories will you tell the world? What stories will it tell of
  you?

  If you answered yes to any of the above, do I have news for you because
  Locomancer lets you PLAY WITH AND RIDE MODEL TRAINS!
  .
  (Also if you answered no to all of the above, come on, we all know you're lying
  to yourself and everyone you love. Take a break from the wave shooters and play
  with some trains.)
  .
  Locomancer is a toy box style model train simulator for touch enabled SteamVR
  headsets. It allows you to build layouts of varying complexity and even defy
  what is physically possible in fake virtual reality (reality).
  .
  Featuring:
  .
  Multiple locomotives including steam and diesel engines
  .
  A variety of rail cars including a fully functional cannon car
  .
  Straight track, curved track, inclined track, loop de loops, and more!
  .
  Various pieces of scenery to add detail your layouts
  .
  Plus, with support for custom scenery, you can bring models created by yourself
  or the community into the game for even further customization. The possibilities
  are nearly endless*!
  .
  Fully embracing the physicality of touch enabled virtual reality you are legally
  required to build layouts piece by piece, tree by tree. Then, once complete you
  must remotely operate your trains with a replica DC control panel or hop in the
  cab of any of the available locomotives and drive them with physical levers,
  knobs, and dials! They even burst in to flames when they crash, you can't say
  that about your real model trains can you?
  .
  Oh...you can? I'd get that checked out if I were you.
  .
  So what are you waiting for? Become The Locomancer!
  .
  Yes, you are the Locomancer. Was that not clear? It's like a train wizard.
  You're like the babe with the power, but instead of voodoo it's train magic.
  Also, there's no magic dance, but you can still dance to twenty-six minutes of
  sweet big band jazz by Nathan Boler if you want to.

game: Locus (USA)

developer: CobblePath Games
publisher: CobblePath Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  What if the world was really against you? What if you couldn't escape? Struggle
  against the stress and pressure of the world - of your own guilt - bearing down
  upon you. There are no heroes here.
  .
  Locus is a bespoke, mystery/horror roleplay game with unique mechanics crafted
  entirely around horror.
  .
  It is a game about flawed character, about exploring consequence and morality
  against a backdrop of very real, supernatural and monstrous danger.
  .
  The game master assumes the position of a Director, who conducts their Cast (the
  players) in their tragic play of characters haunted by their own pasts and a
  scenario which aims to turn those haunts against them.
  .
  The goal is two-fold - to unravel the mystery of the world, and then survive it.
  .
  -----------------------------------------------------
  .
  Locus is ideally played with 2-5 people, with one taking the role of Director
  (GM)
  .
  It requires a Standard Deck of Cards and 3D6 to play.
  .
  It is typically designed for 1-5 sessions of a few hours each.
  .
  ------------------------------------------------------
  .
  Game Features
  .
  Locus offers a number of unique features to facilitate the horror stories it is
  made to tell.
  .
  Negative attributes - You do not decide how well your character might perform
  tasks. Instead, you score how badly they might do.
  .
  Haunts - Every character comes with a Haunt. This is an event in their past that
  weighs upon them. This acts as the focus for the personal horror that character
  must confront.
  .
  Custom made monsters - Locus includes the rules and a guide to create your own
  monsters to reflect each of the player characters, their fears and their
  failings.
  .
  Item cards - Notable items are represented on cards the players can hold.
  However, they degrade with use, making each use a decision with consequences.
  .
  Simple execution - The rules are designed to facilitate horror and provide
  meaningful decisions and cues for characters and Director while not getting in
  the way of the roleplaying experience.
  .
  ---------------------------------------------------
  .
  The Documents
  .
  The game is presented in two documents - a Director's Guide and a Player Guide.
  Potential players should ideally not read the Director's Guide, as it reveals
  many of the secrets they would be aiming to discover in play.   The Player Guide
  covers what you can expect as a player, the rules, character creation and some
  guidance on roleplay, interacting with the world and how certain conflicts will
  play out mechanically.  The Director's Guide contains all the tools needed to
  understand the lore of Locus and build and run your own game, guidance on
  working with players to get the most out of the personalised elements of your
  design including monsters tailor made to the player characters, and a full
  sample campaign.
  .
  Both guides are included in the purchase and both are needed to play.

  Praise for Locus:
  .
  "This game is the definition of 5 stars in my book. The tone of this game is so
  distinct, which is not an easy task in the horror genre where so many things can
  blend together and look the same. The mechanics and game design itself are SO
  clever, from characters rolling against their own negative attributes and the
  system of check difficulty. It all plays so well into how the game calls itself:
  *personal* horror. Locus will be one of my top TTRPG recommendations for a table
  of trusted friends for years to come." -SirHeckalot, TPKRoleplay
  .
  "No exaggeration, this is the best horror RPG I've had the pleasure of playing.
  We streamed a four episode series over the course of a month, and it was
  spectacular! Unique game design, a modular framework that you can mold to fit
  your tables preferred style, incredibly intuitive mechanics... My only caveat
  (and this is far from negative criticism) would be that a session 0 is vital,
  and that everyone at the table should be able to trust each completely.  I can't
  recommend this enough for a mature group of friends that are looking for a
  stellar horror setting to try out!" - Andrew Hooper, LostCaravanRPG.
  .
  "Locus is a unique and innovative horror roleplaying game that takes a different
  approach to traditional tabletop RPGs. The negative attribute system and haunts
  add a personal touch to each character and provide a deeper exploration of their

  Short Description
  .
  Long Gone Days is a 2D modern-day military RPG set in our current times, with a
  focus on language and cultural barriers, inspired by classic dystopian
  literature and visual novels.
  .
  After being deployed to his first mission, Rourke leaves The Core's base for the
  very first time, only to discover the dark truth about the operation he's part
  of and the consequences of deserting an inescapable war.
  .
  With no place to call home now, he must prevent the war from spreading any
  further, forming strong bonds along the way that will forever change his life.
  .
  Communication is Key: As Long Gone Days is set in the real world, you'll
  encounter several language barriers. Recruit interpreters in order to
  communicate with others.
  .
  Keep Morale High: Choose dialogue options wisely as they impact your party
  members' Morale, affecting how they perform during battles. While doing so, keep
  in mind every character has different personality traits and motivations.
  .
  Sniper Mode: Long Gone Days has two battle systems. Using Rourke's rifle, spot
  your enemies and take down your targets.
  .
  No Random Encounters: Long Gone Days features front-view turn-based battles with
  body-targeting system, and every battle is directly related to the plot.

game: Loopy Lore (USA)

developer: CappuccinoGuil
publisher: CappuccinoGuil
genre: Card Game;Role Playing
description:
  Loopy Lore is a co-op storytelling game where friends tell stories from start to
  finish, working together to reach the ending of their story. Using the cards and
  their imagination, they give shape to their tale, taking turns as the narrators
  of the story. Loopy Lore players start the game by drawing cards to create their
  world, plot, protagonist and ending, which are different every time. Each turn,
  the narrator flips a card from a set placed down on the table and must narrate
  its contents for 30 seconds.
  .
  The catch? All cards on the table are placed blindly, meaning they have to
  improvise while the timer is running. How would you, a blood-thirsty viking
  warrior, sneak into a wedding while being mobbed by lemurs? Choose a card and
  find out!
  .
  Players: 2-8
  .
  Time: 60 minutes
  .
  Difficulty: Beginner, Party
  .
  Components:
  .
  6 decks (Setting, Theme, Plot Twist, Role, Action, Place)
  .
  324 poker sized cards
  .
  Manual (7 pages)
  .
  Structure Book (17 pages, 13 Structures)
  .
  World Building Board
  .
  Timer (30 seconds, use your phone if unavailable)
  .
  3 Reuse Tokens (replace with coins, pieces of paper, etc.)
  .
  In Loopy Lore, everything is created on the spot. And we mean everything. World,
  plot, characters, goals, it's all made fresh in a matter of minutes using random
  draws. You will start off by creating all of these using our World Building
  system:
  .
  The ending of the story is composed of a Role, an Action and a Place. This is
  how players win. Reach this ending at the final round and the group wins.
  Remember: you must all work together in order to reach your goal
  .
  The story is constructed using template "Structures" that indicate how long and
  how many cards the story will have. All cards are placed face down on the table,
  so players don't know their content until they are flipped.
  .
  Here's an example of a Structure:
  .
  There are over 2500 plot combinations, 324 cards and 13 structures. Every
  adventure is guaranteed to be a unique story no matter how many times you play.
  .
  During the Storytelling phase, each player gets to flip one card and talk about
  it for 30 seconds. They can guide the tale into whatever direction they feel
  fits their card best, no matter how crazy or out of place it may get (ever seen
  a warlock beatbox? We have). However, other players may interject with a Plot
  Twist during another player's turn. These cards contain strange cues, and could
  be the perfect solution to a particular plot problem or the provide a record-
  scratching reaction out of the other players. Whether your group is digging for
  buried treasure, has to clean up radioactive jam or just cannot stop dancing,
  Plot Twists are the way to shake the story loose.
  .
  On top of all this, Plot Twist offer great perks for the narrator and the group.
  They can give narrators more time to narrate, recover tokens, even allows
  players to look at a faced-down card and choose to remove it from the story if
  they don't like it.
  .
  You can learn more about the game and support us through social media as well!

description:
  Explore an outlandish outer space, gather Loot Cards, and fight your way to The
  Thing Below in this innovative and offbeat strategy roguelike.
  .
  Beat up strange baddies and win Loot Cards which give you special abilities.
  Choosing which to equip requires strategic thinking - the way you lay them out
  is crucial, and some must be sacrificed because cards are also the precious
  resources you need to heal and use powerful abilities.
  .
  Careful though because baddies can loot you! The cards they steal drop into
  other players' games. When you defeat an Elite Baddie you'll get another
  player's card: will you return it or keep it for yourself?
  .
  Either way, prepare for a visit from that player's Holographic Helper to shower
  you with thanks or terrible vengeance - Loot Rascals is a tale of friendship,
  loss, and redemption!
  .
  Every game is different in this procedurally generated roguelike: gather Loot
  Cards, show the Thing Below who's boss, and fly Big Barry to victory!

  Loot the Plutes is the first full TTRPG published using the Four Points RPG
  System.
  .
  Overview
  .
  In this game, you'll play as a gang of swashbuckling rogues in the hyper-
  capitalist plutocratic city of Gilderburg. The city is ruled over by the Circle,
  a group of six obscenely wealthy noble families.
  .
  Listen out for rumours, gather information, plan and attempt heists, evade the
  law and even use enchantments to literally steal from the rich and give to the
  poor.
  .
  Using Four Points, quickly make a character by choosing your Folk and area of
  roguish expertise, then you're ready to start looting!
  .
  A small portion of the Circle's horded wealth.
  .
  The Folk of Gilderburg
  .
  There are six playable Folk to choose from in Loot the Plutes. These are the
  Brell ( Catfolk), K'nach (Ratfolk), Leshvar (Lizardfolk), and the humanoid
  Hillfolk, Mountainfolk and Valleyfolk. Each Folk comes with a set of Traits and
  Abilities which have both narrative and mechanical applications.
  .
  Three nobles, each the head of one of the noble families of Gilderburg.
  .
  Game includes:
  .
  - Setting lore and description
  .
  - Map of Gilderburg
  .
  - Six playable Folk

  Agency and Customisation. This game includes all the necessary rules for playing
  it, and the unabridged Four Points SRD is now available on my itchio store!

  I've made a number of Community Copies available. For every copy of Loot the
  Plutes that is purchased, another Community Copy will be added.

  Disclaimer
  .
  Please note that the setting for Loot the Plutes is a capitalist hell-scape, but
  unlike our own real world version, it does not include any discrimination based
  on colour, appearance, disability, faith (or lack thereof), sex or gender. This
  game does not in any way encourage or attempt to legitimise bringing bigotry and
  hatred to the table.
  .

  collection of various safety tools.

  I have done my best to set everything up correctly, also with regards to
  accessibility. If there are any issues with the documents, please let me know in
  the comments.

developer: Live Real Press
publisher: Live Real Press
genre: Role Playing
description:
  If you would like a print copy of Lords of Eternity, there's a Kickstarter for
  that.
  .
  Lords of Eternity is an epic power fantasy. Play as superhuman beings of immense
  power dueling with swords, saving the world, and competing to take each other's
  heads until you earn the final Prize:  total power and understanding over all
  living things. You are a Master of the U...Lord of Eternity.
  .
  Don't miss Noternus Nights, a serialized campaign and setting for Lords of
  Eternity.
  .
  Long ago, for reasons that have never been clear, one hundred brave souls were
  selected by the Power to have a great destiny. Those chosen felt the Power pour
  into them, changing them. They were granted Abilities beyond that of mere
  mortals, the chance to harness the Power, to shape it to their own ends. Some
  yet appear human. Others have been twisted, formed, shaped by the Power. They've
  grown in physical strength, in intellect, in mechanical aptitude, and in magic.
  .
  These hundred, these chosen few, these immortals have but one destiny. They walk
  among the mortals, struggling to reach the end time, the time of the final
  battle.
  .
  When they battle, the victor seizes the Power from the vanquished and grows
  stronger. Now, after much time has passed, the remaining few are unequaled in
  all of history, mightier than any who have come before. The numbers dwindle,
  leading to the final confrontation.
  .
  The survivors have banded into factions, sworn to defend each other. All know
  that one day, those promises will fail and they will fight to the last. That one
  will claim the Prize: total power and understanding over all living things.
  .
  They are the Lords of Eternity.
  .
  Lords of Eternity offers:
  .
  A simple d6 resolution system with three stats that is Illuminated by LUMEN.
  .
  Over-the-top action and violence. Think cartoon battles. Punches that throw your
  opponents 30 or 40 meters, only to see them stand up, dust off, and return the
  favor, blasters that can shoot down wall, and rocks thrown into orbiting
  spaceships.
  .
  Every superpower from your favorite cartoon franchises is on the table.
  Mechanical limbs, powerful sorcery, incredible strength...it's all there.
  .
  Blur the lines between science and magic. Need an infinitely tall mechanical
  neck, or a dimensional gate that can poof! in zombies? We've got you covered.
  .
  Godlike abilities will happen. When fighting another immortal, players will
  steal their Power for themselves.
  .
  Lords of Eternity is Illuminated by Lumen and inspired by both He-Man and
  Highlander.  In it, you play superhuman immortals battling to take each others'
  heads...and Power. In the end, there can be only one Champion.
  .
  There can be only One! Will it be you?

  As the unfortunate boy who fell into a sinkhole in the 1880s, use your trusty
  lantern and vivid imagination to survive the dangers that dwell deep in the
  heart of the Lost Cave. But beware - not only does the cave become more and more
  treacherous as you struggle to escape, but the boy's prolonged isolation serves
  as a catalyst to his overactive imagination- causing reality and fantasy to
  become indiscernible. To make matters worse, several threatening messages found
  throughout the cave suggest you might not be alone in the cave after all. In the
  present day, join the mysterious tour guide and attempt to shed more light on
  the Lost Cave's enigmatic history.
  .
  Will an outlaw's bias, a young boy's imagination, and a tour guide's research be
  enough to help you discern the truth hidden inside the Lost Cave?

  .
  * Unique puzzle-solving platforming rife with exploration, sparks of action, and
  several hidden secrets to discover
  .
  * Play as characters from the present day and the 1880s to experience the
  ambiguously grim history of the Lost Cave
  .
  * Story-rich narrative weaves together three mysterious characters' stories -
  each with an unreliable point-of-view - that not only takes you on a journey to
  the past and present, but also from the wooded Ozark Mountains and caves, to the
  pirate-infested high seas, the majestic Mount Olympus, eerie Egyptian temples,
  and more!
  .
  * Secret alternate story endings
  .
  * Hand-painted, stylized visuals with diverse settings and characters

description:
  Once Upon a time, there was an unhappy child. All they wanted in life, was to be
  happy, and in their dreams, they were. However, all dreams must come to an end
  someday.
  .
  Lost Dreams is a game created for My First Game Jam.
  .
  The game is very short, only half an hour to an hour long, but it was my first
  venture into creating almost all of the assets used in the game.
  .
  You play a child, who is on a quest to wake up from their blissful dream while
  the inhabitants of their dream world try to, half heartedly, stand in their way.
  The majority of the game are simple puzzles, with atmospheric music and surreal
  inhabitants to the world.
  .
  The game features include:
  .
  Multiple endings (4 bad endings, one normal, and one true ending)
  .
  A rhythm-based battle system
  .
  New Game+
  .
  Various puzzles and riddles
  .
  Warnings for the game include:
  .
  Mention of suicide
  .
  Mentions of abuse and neglect
  .
  Body horror
  .
  Scopophobia
  .
  Trypophobia
  .
  Loud noises
  .
  While I personally am not completely happy with the outcome of the game, I am
  proud of the fact that it is a project that I have actually finished, and am
  looking forward to the next game jam I join.

  The Love Balloon is a light roleplaying story game for 2-6 players inspired by
  the wholesome yet innuendo-laden sitcoms of the late 70's and early 80's - shows
  like The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, and Three's Company.

  No other ship has sailed the winds more than the magnificent Cloud Nine. Welcome
  at any port, its guests - from Kings and Presidents, to Celebrities and
  Athletes, Dentists and even Stowaways  -  all have attested to the ship's
  magical voyages of the heart.
  .
  Come book your stay today and experience what it's like to float your troubles
  away!
  .
  Played with 2-6 players GMless, players create guests on board the Love Balloon
  by establishing a backstory and motivation and sometimes a preexisting
  relationship! Players then follow a specific structure of play prompted by a
  Story Beat and informed by Karma to determine who succeeds or fails in the
  scene.
  .
  The Love Balloon is strictly a PG-13 fantasy where a kiss is the ultimate
  expression of love. Stories told from The Love Balloon tend to be quirky,
  romantic, wholesome, uplifting, and silly.

  In an episode of The Love Balloon you might have:
  .
  The Captain trying to connect with a Celebrity who feels misunderstood.
  .
  A Debutante looking for commitment who happens to be in an unhappy relationship
  with a Hitman losing their memory.
  .
  While a Nerd who needs a break might find sparks with a Musician who has an
  addiction.
  .
  What kind of zany hijinks will our characters get into? Will they confess their
  feelings and find romance? We play to find out!

genre: Visual Novel
description:
  Love Hues! is a university-based visual novel packed with both character and
  world secrets. You'll be playing as Skyler (changeable name and pronouns) and
  navigate your first few months at Falls West University, where you'll meet 5
  romanceable - or befriendable! - characters who hide certain truths about
  themselves and the world around them. This is the full version of the game!
  .
  Love Hues! features 41 unique endings, 5 routes, 228,000+ words, and 32+ CGs.
  .
  Twitter -  Love Hues! Website - Lemmasoft - 2018 Demo
  .
  Characters
  .
  Every character's True ending can be unlocked whether you play their platonic or
  romantic route.
  .
  Toby: 19 years old, they/them. Toby's full of energy and keen to kick off their
  studies in post-secondary - and to join Falls' soccer team! They're troubled by
  their past with a certain other Falls student...
  .
  James: 20 years old, he/him. James is a flirty and cheerful student who is
  determined to become a doctor. He seems to be struggling with his academics and
  well-being lately. Loves archeology and is close with Devlin.
  .
  Nova: 18 years old, she/her. Nova's your neighbor in the dorms, and she's often
  out researching Falls' strange past. She's dedicated to and protective of her
  friends, especially Ava. She may be more entwined in Falls' secrets than she
  tells most folx. (Please note: Nova's route is only unlocked after 1+ ending(s)
  has been achieved!)
  .
  Devlin: 20 years old, he/him. Devlin is the students' union volunteer
  coordinator but tends to seem impersonal. He's passionate about the union's
  success and works tirelessly despite rumors of its financial troubles.
  .
  Ava: 18 years old, she/her. Ava rarely appears to be on campus and tends to be
  anxious and withdrawn. Knows more about Falls and the 'Curiosity' than most.
  .
  (Please note that Ava's route requires all True endings to be unlocked.)
  .
  Choose wisely...
  .
  Certain choices in routes will add new scenes to other routes you've already
  experienced or will unlock secret content. Learn as much as you can about Falls'
  true origins by exploring the game from every angle, and see if you can
  understand what everyone means when they whisper the Curiosity's name...
  .
  Pick your appearance and pronouns!
  .
  Pick the main character appearance you like + your pronouns - you can romance or
  befriend anyone in the cast regardless of your choice!
  .

  Overview
  .
  Play through an engaging and emotional story set in a deep world full of its own
  original mythology and history. The universe and all its inhabitants have been
  reincarnated, but the world's structure isn't how it should be. Those who can
  dream are considered cursed in this society. You'll solve the mysteries behind
  the Dreamers, and even enter into their Dreamspaces for unique, interesting
  areas to explore.
  .
  Take advantage of the Dual Soul class system, switching between Pure and Veil
  classes in the heat of battle, to conquer challenging enemies and bosses.
  .
  Note: The game has an optional 'Lucid Awakening 1 Primer' in-game that will tell
  you everything you need to know about Lucid Awakening 1. This way you can start
  off with Lucid Awakening 2.

  Story Overview
  .
  Dual Soul System
  .
  Zeke, Silas, and Terra have the ability to transform into various 'Souls.' These
  forms are actually the result of their bodies recreating past lives they lived
  in previous Epochs.
  .
  Each of the three characters has their own unique set of Pure and Veil Souls
  they will obtain throughout the story. You can assign one Pure and one Veil Soul
  outside of battle, then freely switch between the two in battle.
  .
  All enemies are also either Pure or Veil. Souls and enemies deal more damage to
  the opposing alignment but deal less damage to the same alignment. They will
  also receive more damage from the opposing alignment and take less damage from
  the same alignment.

  Everyone is a suspect. Unmask their lies. Choose one to purge.
  .
  Lucifer Within Us asks you to solve short, player-directed, story rich mysteries
  with your wits, making observations and deductions in a world of daemonic
  possession and invasive soul-scanning technology.
  .
  From the creator of The Shrouded Isle.
  .
  Investigate timelines. Question your suspects. Watch their movements and
  testimonies closely, as the reconstruction may be based on lies. Use
  contradictions and clues to form your own hypothesis. Who is lying and why? Who
  is possessed? You must decide what is the truth for yourself, based on the
  evidence presented.
  .
  Real mystery-solving. No hidden plot twists, no QTEs, no random puzzles or mini-
  games, just you and the information. Don't just act like a detective -- BE a
  detective in 3 murder cases. Finding the murderer will require true
  understanding of the case, not just following the story.
  .
  Banish daemonic A.I. Enter the minds of citizens to gain insight into what they
  don't want you to know. Dig through their subconscious and accuse the guilty in
  order to cast out their daemons, for the good of the Inquisition. Any damage
  done to a citizen's psyche as a result of quarantine, exorcism, or
  rehabilitation is a consequence of their own immorality.
  .
  Expose the False Utopia. Through centuries of indoctrination, humanity is taught
  to think pure thoughts and speak true words, untainted by falsehoods and
  delusions. Yet beneath this facade of purity, you find dark desires stir deep
  within people's hearts, yearning for release.
  .
  As a digital exorcist working for the Church of Ain Soph's Inquisition, it is
  your duty to find sinners and ensure continued harmony. Digital daemons corrupt
  the network cause human hosts to act on secret desires and sins, even unto
  murder. Discover the One Truth to determine which citizens are infected and
  exorcise the possessed.
  .
  Built on the rubble of the Old World, the last human city has become a utopia of
  progress, digitization, and art. The Church guides citizens towards advancement
  and Truth with the aid of a digital consciousness network.
  .
  Use all of the tools at your disposal to find the truth, wherever it may hide...
  and beware the lies you tell yourself.

  Funomena's award-winning Luna is now on itch.io
  .
  Overview
  .
  A Bird's peaceful summer slumber is disturbed by the majestic call of a
  mysterious Owl. Enticed to swallow the last piece of the waning Moon, Bird is
  blown far from its Golden Gate home.
  .
  Re-awaken shadowy forests and bring life back to sparkling lakes. Discover
  hidden creatures, help Bird reunite the fragmented Moon... and find its way
  home.
  .
  Solve celestial puzzles to unlock each level's tree, plants and animal spirits.
  .
  Place, customize and interact with them in miniature, musical terrariums.
  .
  Bring each world to life, revealing Austin Wintory's haunting, enchanting score.
  .
  Brought to you by Funomena's uniquely diverse team of veteran developers
  (Journey, Flower, Boom Blox, The Sims 2), Luna is an interactive fable about
  learning by the light of unexpected mistakes.
  .
  Luna started off in partnership with Intel and their RealSense Camera
  technology, but as the project evolved, and hand-tracked VR controllers began to
  emerge, we partnered with Oculus to bring the game to the Touch. The non-VR PC
  version was released shortly after the original launch date. The storybook
  edition later updated the core game with a voice over narrative & localized
  subtitles to further elucidate Luna's heartfelt story.
  .
  You can find out more about how the idea for Luna came to be through these
  tweets by Robin Hunicke. Luna is a very personal game for Robin, and we hope
  it'll touch you like it has already touched others across the world.

  Reviews

  "Without so much as a single word, Luna traps us within its narrative fantasy,

  literary chunks." Gameranx
  .
  "This process is truly special and unique because the more time you take with
  it, the more beautiful and rewarding the world will look..." 8.6 - The Nerd Mag

file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/M/MMM - Murder Most Misfortunate (USA)/MMM - Murder Most Misfortunate (USA).json
developer: Foolish Mortals
publisher: Foolish Mortals
genre: Visual Novel;Interactive Fiction
description:
  A gruesome murder interrupts an evening party at a secluded mansion and you are
  the prime suspect! Explore the mansion, search for clues, and interrogate the
  other guests as you strive to unmask the killer in this open-ended mystery.
  .
  A murder is committed in a secluded mansion, and it's up to you to solve it.
  .
  MMM is a visual novel adventure with an open-ended mystery that puts your
  deductive skills to the test. A murder occurs in a secluded manor, and if you
  can't find the killer in time, you just might take the blame for the crime
  yourself! Gather information and search the house for clues as you form your own
  conclusions about the evening's mysterious events.
  .
  Features
  .
  Multiple Endings: Finding the true killer is ideal, of course, but maybe
  building a plausible case against one of the other characters is good enough to
  get you off the hook!
  .
  Unique and Compelling Characters: Play as Miss Fortune, a delightfully caustic
  anti-heroine who has already been widowed nine times. But this time, she didn't
  do it (really!), and she'll have to solve the mystery herself to prove it!
  .
  Immersive Story: Sharply written dialog full of choices ensures a thoroughly
  immersive narrative.
  .
  Voice-acting: Each character is fully voiced, with over 1700 voiced lines
  throughout the game!
  .
  Beautiful Visuals: Detailed, searchable backgrounds and slick visual effects
  like rain, fog and variable lighting enhance the aesthetic experience.
  .
  Time runs Short: The incompetent police are on their way. Better solve the
  mystery before they arrive, lest they come to their own (wrong) conclusions.
  .
  MMM is available for Mac, Linux & Windows computers.
  .
  It has full-English voice acting, and text in English, Italian or Spanish.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  The MYNT system is designed to focus on storytelling through roleplaying. It can
  work with any setting. Combat is possible but it is not the focus of this
  system. It was designed to get players doing more than swinging swords or
  shooting blasters with the aim of beating a particular number in order to
  succeed. Action and adventure occur through twists and not continued success on
  the part of the hero.
  .
  Think Han Solo, Indiana Jones or Jack Sparrow having to talk, trick or fight
  their way out of a situation and being smart about it, but things never quite
  going as they planned. This system is designed for just such events. (How sad is
  it that I can only think of male characters that act in this manner.)

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Being a taxi driver is a tough job already. Being a taxi driver with your third
  eye wide open and a kind heart makes it even harder. "Ma'amser, Saan Po Kayo?"
  translates (roughly) in English to "Ma'am/sir, where to?". This is a 2-4 hour
  micro-RPG designed for 3-5 players. It's about bringing passengers where they
  need to be at night. Pilot a kind-hearted cabbie who does their round in Metro
  Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Have some of your friends play your
  familiars - spirits or monsters that you helped in the past, and are now trying
  to pay it forward. This is a city where there are just as many spirits as there
  are people, and they need help too. Take that wheel, hang some sampaguita on
  your rearview mirror, fire up Waze. Your passengers are waiting.
  .
  No previous knowledge of Filipino folklore is needed in order to play this game!
  In fact, I designed it with a foreign audience in mind. The game has an
  extensive page on landmarks in Metro Manila, some examples of the spoopy
  monsters that haunt our local lore, and references for people who want to know
  more.

description:
  Mable & The Wood is a Metroidvania where you can take the form of the bosses
  that you kill, changing how you're able to explore the interconnected world.
  It's also a Metroidvania where you don't have to kill anyone.
  .
  The strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you
  will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save
  this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose
  their meaning with time...
  .
  When the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The
  Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you
  might kill everyone.
  .
  Will you banish the darkness, or will you become it?
  .
  COMBAT IS MOVEMENT
  .
  The way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable
  shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to
  your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.
  .
  You can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing
  creatures extends your power.
  .
  HUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE
  .
  Defeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa,
  spider and more...
  .
  Find and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!
  .
  EXPLORE A DYING WORLD
  .
  The game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a
  large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to
  discover.
  .
  Uncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through
  the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)
  .
  DISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE
  .
  Discover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the
  saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to
  the world literally tearing itself apart?
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Your choices matter - The cult wants you to kill everything, but it's up to you
  whether or not you listen to them or find your own path and unlock the multiple
  endings
  .
  A rich story with a diverse cast of characters who have their own take on this
  whole 'end of the world' thing
  .
  Combat is movement and movement is combat - Mable can't lift her magical sword,
  so she has to use it in unique ways to move through the world
  .
  A large and varied fantasy world brought to life with state-of-the-art pixel
  technology and a beautiful original soundtrack
  .
  Multiple endings, different routes to take through the world and secrets to
  discover

developer: Jordan Palmer
publisher: Jordan Palmer
genre: Role Playing
description:
  In Mage Against The Machine you take on the roll of time-travelling wizards
  attempting to stop the robot apocalypse.  You will travel back to the moments in
  your lives you have the most connection to in the hopes of finding the events
  that set in motion the destruction of civilization. But meddling with reality
  comes at a cost. Each time you use your magic to alter the world you generate
  anomalies, push too hard and the things you care about most may no longer exist
  in the present.
  .
  Players will create their character by giving them a defining memory they are
  able to travel back to. Unlike many other games, Mage Against The Machine
  doesn't use a GM. Instead the player whose moment it is fills in all the
  details; this player is also unable to take any direct action to alter the
  timeline or risk catastrophic destruction. Each player will get a chance to take
  on the role of answering the other players' questions as you visit that moment.
  .
  All the players are still responsible for keeping the game interesting. There
  are two big ways the game encourages this. First, when a player rolls a failure
  any player can jump in and explain why the plan didn't work. Additionally, as
  players generate anomalies by messing with time they can be spent to alter any
  detail provided by the player answering questions about their moment.
  .
  After the players have visited each moment and stopped the moments that lead to
  the machine uprising comes the resolution phase. Each player rolls multiple dice
  based on how many anomalies were caused in their moment to determine if and how
  exactly the thing they cared about most has been warped in the present. Mage
  Against The Machine is a game about risking it all, delving into memories, and
  coping with loss.

  Now live on Kickstarter! https://magus-oracle.com/ks
  .
  The Magus is a solo journaling tabletop RPG that takes you on a sweeping journey
  for power, ambition, and arcane mastery, at great personal and interpersonal
  cost.
  .
  For the entirety of February, 100% of sales went directly to charity. While that
  period has ended, every contribution is still dearly appreciated. See update.
  .
  About
  .
  As a journaling game, you will roll dice, track stats, create spells, and write
  imaginary experiences from the perspective of your character: a wizard, newly
  embarking on their quest for power, their head filled with grand visions of
  mastery.
  .
  I finally mastered the Forge Chain spell. I had to create a pact with a demon --
  forgive me Elia -- but it is worth it. It has to be. It's the only way to bring
  peace to the kingdom...and glory to me.
  .
  This RPG is crunchy. You will use several polyhedral dice to manage four traits:
  Focus, Power, Control, and Scars, which shape how the protagonist overcomes
  challenges and meets their denouement after seven, fateful events.
  .
  Perhaps they sail to the Enigmatic North in search of the final homonculus.
  .
  Perhaps they burrow deep underground to escape their eldritch overlords.
  .
  Or perhaps they go mad with power, and plunder innocent lives for M O R E
  .
  Everything comes at a cost, however: will you spend your scant remaining time to
  acquire more powerful spells, or nurture the few connections keeping you human?
  .
  Overcome fantastic challenges with your fledgling power, meet strange creatures
  along the way, and fly close to the sweet sun of omnipotence.
  .
  Featuring fifty exquisitely-designed pages, The Magus is a memorable experience
  about sacrifice, loneliness, and the power of magic and pathos coursing through
  all of us.

  What is the next step
  .
  We currently have a prototype that is already functional but with lack of
  content to play (characters, skins, sounds, music, etc ...).
  .
  "Create Your Adventure" is focused on content. You can see the characters
  included in the official package by now, but we need more assets and about more
  related topics.
  .
  The more resources we put at your disposal to create, the more we will boost
  your inspiration, the more stories you will create and the more stories you will
  be able to play.
  .
  Next Kickstarter campaign can finance more assets and drive them by your
  interests. Therefore most rewards are oriented with this goal with affordable
  cost.

  rebellious teens deal with the brute force of consumer-based capitalism.

  Kind Words
  .
  "Tonight's game was the most fun I've ever had roleplaying. I ran Mall Kids for
  a very full table and now we are #cinnabonded. I literally laughed for 4 hours
  straight and my face hurts and my heart is so full." - Jillian, @OrbWitch
  .
  "The thing I love about Mall Kids is how successfully it mashes Grant Howitt-
  inspired gonzoism and John Hughsian soulful teen drama. It's goofy like Honey
  Heist, and yes somebody did turn into a bird, but we also explored the nervous
  excitement of a teenager asking out his crush for the first time." -

  A rider looms on the road ahead. His tattered clothes and ravaged face competes
  for grotesquery with his mangy, tick-riddled horse. His hefty baggage bulges
  temptingly. Would you dare rob a man on the road?
  .
  This pamphlet adventure for Old-School Essentials answers the question: What if
  an apparently typical random encounter held far more in store than the party
  would ever dream of bargaining for. Contained here is a single, devilishly
  difficult to kill NPC with endless tricks up his sleeves, including:
  .
  False identities to lure the party into careless complacency.
  .
  Fighting styles and underhanded tactics to thwart any plan and keep the party on
  their toes.
  .
  Foul vulgarities unleashed by his fetid tongue, such as: Pestilent corpse fit
  only to satisfy a blind mule and blaspheming devil-humper.
  .
  Worthy and strange loot to reward the victorious.
  .
  And more.

  Dive Deeper into Adventure with "Mapping the Catacombs" - Now Expanded into a
  Full Book!
  .
  Mapping the Catacombs is a single-player text-based adventure game that can also
  be incorporated into group play by a Game Master. In this game, players create
  and lead a party of adventurers through a dangerous and labyrinthine catacomb,
  with the ultimate goal of finding treasure and successfully exiting the
  catacombs.
  .
  To play the game, players need paper, pencil, at least one six-sided die (d6),
  and a coin. The game progresses in turns, with each turn having three general
  steps: draw a circle to represent a chamber, roll for encounter and resolve it,
  and roll for chamber connections and choose a path.
  .
  Players start by creating their adventuring party by choosing or rolling for a
  character type and rolling for their hit points (HP). They also need to
  determine the characters' sources of light and track fuel usage. Fear plays an
  important role, as characters can become lost in the catacombs if their fear
  reaches a certain threshold.
  .
  Encounters are resolved by rolling 2d6 and referring to the 2d6 Chamber Contents
  table. Some encounters may require a coin toss to determine advantage or
  disadvantage. Attacking and defending mechanics are based on rolling d6, with
  successful hits subtracting HP from the target.
  .
  Throughout the game, players must keep track of their party's health, light, and
  fear levels, as well as any potential catacomb confusion. Diligent mapping is
  crucial to retracing the path for a safe exit.
  .
  A solo pen & paper RPG featuring a unique catacomb mapping system. Also great
  for one shot adventures.

  "Stark stylised flair in a 'realistic' forest is a great look. It can feel like
  how old horror movies used lighting, fog, and lens filters to blast
  otherworldliness, which is great...  Good stuff."
  .
  -Alice O'Connor, RPS
  .
  " It isn't just the striking visuals or the eldritch underpinnings of this entry

  with drawn out presentation in a way one would only typically come to expect
  from the cinema."

  "The porter drew a map for me on the back of a brochure. In smudged pencil he
  showed me where to turn from the main road onto a dirt road and then where to
  leave the road entirely. I left the streetlights behind me and traveled into the
  dark."

  Marginalia is a first-person horror game that transports you to Kestlebrook, a
  secluded valley where history becomes enmeshed with a strange present. Weeks ago
  Eric left. Days ago you got a letter telling you to come to him. Now you're
  here, but precisely where is here? And better yet, when?
  .
  Features:
  .
  Two plotlines that interweave with one another to tell the full story of
  Kestlebrook.

  Beautiful environment hand-crafted by the developers.

  A story about loss and what a person will do to fix a broken past.

  Kelsey has come back to a room packed up in boxes. She has one goal - get
  Marie's journal. When she picks it up, the memories come back. Because twenty
  years ago Kelsey and Marie shared this room. They spent days in it working on

  future, planning their life. Until that ghastly night. When it was all shattered
  to pieces.

  pick up objects. Learn what Kelsey remembers, read what Marie thought about it.
  As you puzzle the pieces together, you uncover the secrets of their friendship.

  "She asked me why I was so angry all the time. And I told her -- because it's a
  dirty deal. It's Russian roulette and utterly unfair. The cards I'd been dealt,
  any player would have passed. I chose to be angry instead. But Marie, my friend
  Marie, she got me a new deck. And suggested that I deal again." - Kelsey

  .
  THE MARTIAL CULT OF BLOOD KNIGHT GAIUS is a 20-page dungeon crawl about a
  religious order of vampires who deny their feeding urges, instead only drinking
  the blood of those whom they have given a formal chance to defend themselves.
  .
  The spells, items. and monsters described in this zine are intended for use with
  Ben Milton's Knave, but can also be quickly converted for use with B/X or other
  OSR derivatives. In this zine, you'll find:
  .
  NINE MONSTERS AND NPCS: Encounter feral and ravenous Mad Vampires, cyclopean
  Mountain Screamers, dashing and flamboyant Vampire Knights, a foolhardy
  adventurer called Sycorax, the craven and backstabbing Demon Priest Morpho, and
  more!
  .
  TWO HARD-HITTING BOSSES: Compete in a duel for a fabulous reward with the
  brooding cult leader Blood Knight Gaius, and encounter his bodyguard and trusted
  companion, the mysterious giant First Disciple Matsunaga.
  .
  EIGHT SPELLBOOKS AND ENCHANTED ITEMS: Steal Matsunaga's limb-cleaving claymore,
  wear the Blood Knight's cloak of stars, and gain crystal-control over the Demon
  Priest Morpho. Read from the spell tomes of the Monastery and learn to summon a
  full moon, turn the floor into a sea of fire, become a classic movie vampire,
  and forge a blade from your own blood!
  .
  EVEN MORE OSR GOODNESS: Build tension with a rumors table about Matsunaga, set
  the mood with passages of prose to read to your players, flesh out the story
  with four reasons to visit the Cult and three possible Epilogues, map out the
  Monastery courtesy of watabou, and gaze upon three full-page illustrations by
  yours truly!
  .
  While the tone of the adventure is meant to be pulpy and spooky, prominent
  themes include religion, starvation, shame, blood, and slight body horror.
  Please confirm that each of your players are comfortable with these themes
  before you play!
  .
  NOTES
  .
  In a previous version of the module, I suggested players listen to an album by
  Old Tower. I have been informed that Old Tower is associated with Nazi black
  metal acts. Please do not purchase, stream, or support the music of Old Tower.
  Check out ...and in the autumn night the black castle rose by Draped in Shadows
  instead!
  .
  On page 10, the final random encounter is First Disciple Matsunaga, with no
  information about the encounter. Guidelines for how to handle Matsunaga randomly
  appearing in the dungeon are listed on the two-page spread addressing the
  character.

  Maze Of Bears is a wrapping grid-based puzzle game in which to find your lost
  cats, you must evade bears, bulls, spiders, wolves, lasers , land mines, fire,
  ice, pits, and bear traps. To solve each of the 150 levels you'll learn how to
  push, pull, rubiks-slide, defuse, mirror-bounce, stealth, heat, freeze, climb,
  dig, teleport, tornado, clone and sneak.
  .
  Every level has a new idea. Starting simply, you'll soon learn how to use each
  of the 16 different bonus powers to manipulate the interactions between the 30
  different types of block. Things slowly get very complicated, especially given
  that every level wraps the top and bottom, left and right of the screen.
  Fortunately the hint system spells out how to complete every level, so you won't
  get stuck.
  .
  Add to that a simple to use Level Editor, and a customisable Random Level
  Generator, so there's that...
  .
  PC demo has 36 levels available. Feedback would be massively appreciated.
  .
  If you like the demo and want try the rest of the 150 levels you can purchase
  the full version.

  - 2D Onigiri Platformer -
  .
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  .
  When you put a onigiri in your mouth, you can change your state of being.
  .
  It will lead you to the Cat Statue, a power spot at the end of each stage, which
  is a bit of a challenge. This is a jump action game.
  .
  If you put a onigiri in your mouth, you will go to the "Onigiri state".
  .
  By chewing and swallowing the rice ball in your mouth, you can change to
  "Normal" mode.
  .
  In Normal Mode, you can turn everyone into a rice ball by firing a shot, but the
  .
  You cannot fire a shot while in Onigiri state.
  .
  Also, in the "normal" state, you can't touch "everyone" which would be a miss.
  .
  In the "Onigiri State" you can be friendly and touch each other without making a
  mistake.
  .
  It's important in this game world to switch between these two different states,
  depending on the situation .
  .
  What is the purpose of the "I" who moves on despite enduring the pain over and
  over again?
  .
  What is the true meaning of the message "Cat" tells us?

  The answer may lie beyond the (true) ending.

  Meeting in the Flesh is a free horror/romance visual novel. You play as Vil, the
  resident of a strange but friendly little city, encountering various people and
  getting the chance to court one of three different monstrous suitors. Though the
  game will include some body horror imagery, the game is a romance at its core,
  with a focus on getting to know and growing closer to your partner. It features
  romantic scenes that can be toggled between a PG-13 and R rating.
  .
  The world of Meeting in the Flesh is full of interesting faces, but Vil is
  pretty close to three in particular ...
  .
  Yiestol is the community overlook. Kind and gentle and takes great pride in his
  work. He cares deeply about others.
  .
  Brattan is a salt scout. Very friendly and outgoing. He loves adventure and
  excitement, and wants to discover something big!
  .
  Nyargh is the owner of a bee shop. Though gruff and stoic, he's in no way mean.
  However, he's surrounded by some odd rumors ... ?
  .
  ==========================================
  .
  Meeting in the Flesh is available for absolutely free! A small 'Thank You
  Booklet' is available to anyone who donates $2.00 or more, as a show of our
  appreciation. It contains a small collection of rough sketches, progress shots,
  and unused versions of artwork from the game.

  (For anyone who previously donated that amount or more to the project while it
  was in production, please email us at inkethic@gmail.com, and we would be more
  than happy to send you the booklet as a belated thank you!)

  Memoir En Code: Reissue is an autobiographical game album. Designed to be
  experienced similarly to a music album, this short experimental game explores
  different bits of the author's life.
  .
  Divided in different interactive tracks, the game leads the player through the
  exploration of very personal moments, from the struggle of keeping together a
  long-distance relationship to the exploration of childhood memories.
  .
  Memoir En Code: Reissue was designed, developed and produced by only one person
  in the attempt to explore autobiography in games.

  F.A.Q.
  .
  How does Reissue differ from the original Memoir En Code released in 2015?
  .
  The game features all new graphics, interface, and parts of it have been re-
  designed. Reissue also includes a new final track to give closure to the game,
  plus the dev commentary. Take it as a sort of HD Remaster Extended Director's
  Cut edition.
  .
  Should I buy this game?
  .
  If you like experimental games, yes.
  .
  If you don't like experimental games, maybe.
  .
  If you give more value to content than length, yes.
  .
  If you give more value to length than content, no.

  Can I put a Let's Play video on YouTube?

  Yes BUT, considering that the game is fairly short, I'd appreciate if you could
  at least avoid recording the new (last) track called Lei Disse as well as the

game: Mendel (USA)

developer: OwenTheBell
publisher: OwenTheBell
genre: Simulation
description:
  Mendel is a science creativity sandbox. Pilot a probe on a far away planet,
  gathering samples from the weird native flowers and breeding them together to
  make new hybrids. Watch their genes merge and mutate, just like those of our own
  world, producing strange new creations to grow in your alien gardens.
  .
  Grow your own Proteus. No goals. No objectives. No pressure. Just a peaceful
  sandbox in which to experiment, create, and relax.
  .
  Tens of thousands of possible surreal plants.
  .
  Watch your plants change and mutate as their genes combine and rearrange, just
  like those or our own world.
  .
  Inspired by science! Mendel is the first game to receive the Alfred P Sloan
  Foundation Public Understanding prize, because they recognized a commitment to
  showing how beautiful the world of genetics is.
  .
  "It was kind of like bubble wrap. You really get into it and can't stop planting
  and trying to make them do things."
  .
  -Natalie Lawhead, creator of Tetrageddon and Everything Is Going To Be Ok
  .
  "Mendel is a beautiful game of digital exploration, inviting experimentation,
  reflection and calm."
  .
  - Jacob Wood, Indie Hangover

description:
  I reread this poem recently and it inspired a game.
  .
  The intended experience is for two players to play on one keyboard.  If you
  touch hands it's okay, good fences make good neighbors.  You can also play by
  yourself.
  .
  Move along the wall and patch it up.  Once a rock is gone, it's gone.  Nature's
  first green is gold, ya know?
  .
  The demo is 1 year long; the full version goes until you lose.  I imagine 100%
  of the money I make on this game will go toward buying baby formula, so consider
  that before supporting.
  .
  Feel free to share your highscore and experience!  This was originally supposed
  to be a chill experience but I couldn't help myself, I added a score :\

  Meridian - A Story Game of Journeys Wondrous and Fantastical
  .
  Experience a kaleidoscopic city of dreamlike wonder!
  .
  There are stories of journeys that give us a sense of wonder and magic, tales
  that take us through worlds of imagination and sensual evocation. Meridian is a
  storytelling game that will enable you and your friends to create your own such
  accounts. It gives you an ever-shifting map and cast of characters, but you make
  each journey unique.
  .
  Meridian is a game based on different player roles and colorful prompts. It
  includes:
  .
  3 sets of Journeyer cards (Defiance, Obsession, Devotion)
  .
  1 set of Guide cards
  .
  3 Touch cards
  .
  5 sets of Companion cards
  .
  54 cadences in 3 sets: Quirky Creatures, Fleeting Moments, and Dread&Doubt
  .
  17 Locales in 3 sets: Capricious Festival, Bumpy Rides, and Dark Reflections
  .
  1 rulebook
  .
  This is the print&cut version of the game; only PDFs are provided. This means a
  lot of assembly is required! You can also order the physical boxed set from The
  Game Crafter. The game was originally funded via Kickstarter, and there's still
  a lot of information about it on the KS page.
  .
  Brie Beau Sheldon published an interview about the game that has more
  information.
  .
  You can also watch a video showing setup and gameplay.
  .
  Finally, you can play with a subset of the cards on Tabletop Simulator with this
  free workshop mod.
  .
  Here is some feedback from people who have journeyed to Meridian:
  .
  "The best session I played all year was that session of Meridian! It pulls at
  the heart strings." -- Jamie Fristrom, Happion Labs.
  .
  "The roles in Meridian are playful and exciting, with each of the three
  -Journeyer, Guide, and Companion- making for very different play experiences.
  Lots of replay value there alone, with each being easy enough for a passionate
  first timer." -- Jackson Tegu (RPG designer, on Patreon).
  .
  "Everything about this was so, so imaginative! I can't wait to play this again
  and experience more places, and creatures and choices!" -- Adrienne Mueller.
  .
  "Every con I go to I have one experience, very early on, that I I say to myself
  'Okay. I can go home now. That was worth the price of admission and it's not
  gonna get better.' These experiences keep me coming back to cons. Meridian
  eclipsed them all." -- Dylan Green.
  .
  "The cards have enough evocative prompts to help those who are stuck and the
  details of each Locale are lyrical and beautifully framed." -- Shuo Meng
  (Assistant Editor and Designer of the #Feminism Anthology).

description:
  Surrealist point-and-click adventure game with some word play, a whole lot of
  escapism, a dab of humor, and a dollop of existential dread.
  .
  The idea for the story came from constantly dreaming about being stuck in small
  indoor spaces and looking for nature. Likely a reflection of living in
  quarantine.
  .
  While not the first creation in The Abandoned universe, this is the first
  released creation. We currently have a Graphic Novel in the works as well as a
  larger game. Join us at https://aesth.games/ for updates on those endeavors.

  Update 2021-02-14: Added the OST for sale.
  .
  Update 2021-02-01: Official release!
  .
  Update 2020-12-01: Made several improvements to the text, as well as QoL changes

  Each character was assigned to give a statement to be posted on this store page.
  Their responses are below:
  .
  CHRIS: Hello! I'm so excited that you're considering playing our game! I'll tell
  you as much as I can. So we're actually not the full game. We're the demo! No
  one knows if the real game is out yet or not, or what genre we're really
  supposed to be....it's kind of confusing. But that's just fine, I guess! Anyway,
  I suppose it's already been determined where you'll be going and what kinds of
  things you might be doing? I hope I get to actually meet you later. I've really
  been looking forward to it! Have a nice day!
  .
  HOPE: hey if u get any choices that lead u to a mochi store go there thats where
  the cool ppl in the game r if you dont youll probably lose ok bye
  .
  ASPEN: Hey YOU! Yeah, YOU! Wanna chat it up with some cute girls? (And a super
  cute non-binary person?) Then you've definitely found the right game! We're not
  like those other inferior dating simulators. We have the advantage of knowing
  who, how, why, and what we truly are! Well, uh...mostly. That's where you come
  in! You can be the one to tell us once and for all what we're really doing here!
  And with the help of your good buddy Aspen, we'll ensure that this game gets its
  best ending! Our fate rests upon your shoulders, O wise player!
  .
  NARI: [Declined to give a statement.]
  .
  ISADORA: WHAT?!??! MY QUOTE IS GOING TO BE LAST????? THAT'S NO FAIR!!! YOU
  SHOULD CHANGE IT SO THAT I'M, LIKE, AT LEAST SECOND? OR THIRD?!?!!? LAST IS SO
  STUPID!!!!!! NARI DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING AND SHE'S NOT EVEN LAST!!!!!
  UUUUUGGGGGGGGGGG (...wait so what exactly should I say then? ...oh, ok.) Hi! I'm
  Isadora, and...uh... (Oh, whatever, this is so stupid! Was that enough? Can I go
  now?)

game: Michtim - Fluffy Adventures (USA)

developer: Georg Zev Mir
publisher: Georg Zev Mir
genre: Adventure
description:
  Michtim is my love letter to Saturday morning cartoons like Ewoks and David the
  Gnome (David der Kabauter in German). It's also an idealistic game, because in
  this game, it's not about the monsters you slay - quite contrary. It's about
  exploring a world that's larger and hostile, but that holds wonder and
  amazement. Michtims want to protect nature; and they want to set humans back on
  the path to a better life. It can be a heartwarming experience; but it also has
  tight mechanics and can handle fights.
  .
  Watch this concise and wonderful review on TikTok by goblinmixtape!
  .
  The game features a totally unique System. Your traits are Emotions, and on
  rolls that come up as 6, you generate Mood markers of the appropriate emotion.
  Your character can also have a combination of 12 Callings. These are very
  minimalistic and simple on one hand, but you can combine them however you like
  and the best thing: you can play an Angry, a Compassionate or a Scaredy-Cat
  Cook. There are no favored Stats in this game, so each Class can be played in 5
  very radically different ways!
  .
  This game means a lot to me, since it marks my graduation into a full fledged
  Master of Arts; but it's also the baby of my disabled partner Alex and myself.
  We always lacked a space that was welcoming to us; and with Michtim, we
  basically wanted to offer peeps a place that's free from oppression.
  .
  I really hope you enjoy the game, and as a special offer for you itch-
  friendlies, I have added all the previously add-on DIY card printing files for
  FREE.
  .
  If you want to buy physical copies, you can get them on my DriveThruRPG.

  This is a tribute to two of my favorite games of my childhood called Boulder
  Dash (C-64) and Metroid (NES).
  .
  In the middle 1980's I was a kid of seven or eight years. My uncle had got a
  brand new commodore 64 computer and my younger brother and I used to play all
  the exciting games of that times. For me at this time, the world was full of
  monsters dungeons and dragons hiding in the shadows. It was a fantastic time and
  I remember myself fighting through all this particularly hard games lost in the
  8-Bit worlds that turned into real adventures.
  .
  Micro Dash is Boulder Dash like game but with a lot of new elements and
  metroidvania features like tiny story-line, power-ups and a lot of secrets and
  hidden caves. The graphics and sound is close to the one from the original C-64
  Boulder Dash from 1986. Also the game-play is similar to the original. The
  player controls Nano, who must dig through caves collecting gems and diamonds
  and reach the exit, while avoiding various types of dangerous creatures as well
  as falling rocks or get killed by an underground explosion.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Up to four game save slots. Players can use different game slots to play
  together by player-rotation
  .
  Six worlds with about 10 to 20 caves per world to eke out plus bonus world
  .
  Up to six power-ups. Each power-up gives you a unique ability
  .
  Secrets and hidden rooms that are waiting to be found
  .
  A lot of new elements like Emeralds, Ghosts and Spiders, Keys, Doors and
  Portals, Laval, Slime and more
  .
  Up to six different color themes and six different extra cave themes
  .
  Multiple goals such like:
  .
  Solve all caves
  .
  find all power-ups
  .
  find THE lost diamond
  .
  find all secrets and opals and unlock the bonus world
  .
  make a high score

  Reviews
  .
  "It's got style... It gets you thinking. It gets your toe tapping as well
  because the music in this is fantastic... This is a clever reintroduction of
  puzzle and rhythm fusion."
  .
  8.0 Marissa / 8.0 Victor - Reviews on the Run
  .
  "Micron presents a perfect blend of aesthetically-pleasing visuals and head-
  bopping music that is sure to leave you thinking about the game long after
  you've completed it."
  .
  4.5/5 stars - Operation Rainfall
  .
  "Micron is more of an interactive audio-visual experience than just a simple
  puzzle game, and if you're at all into retro styled games and music this is a
  puzzler you just can't miss." - CGRUndertow
  .
  About Micron
  .
  Micron is a unique fusion of puzzle and rhythm gameplay. Place pieces on the
  board to deflect bullets of energy that fire to the beat. Guide the bullets to
  the exit through 51 challenging levels - and 12 bonus levels - featuring a
  variety of distinctive soundscapes. Your solutions create the music.
  .
  Award Winning Design
  .
  Micron began as a game created for Kongregate's 'Project Eden: Experience the
  Music' game contest, in which it won 2nd place. The judges included Tetsuya
  Mizuguchi, creator of REZ and LUMINES, and representatives from Ubisoft,
  Gamespot, and Kongregate.
  .
  "Classic visual like the Famicon but experiencing the process of sound effects
  evolving into the music felt really good. The harder the game, the more exciting
  the music gets-this was blended perfectly." - Tetsuya Mizuguchi

game: Midnight Manor (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/M/Midnight Manor (USA)/Midnight Manor (USA).json
developer: travm
publisher: travm
genre: Platformer
description:
  Midnight Manor is a short, spooky pick-em-up platformer inspired by games like
  Bible Adventures, Super Mario Bros 2, and Lakeview Cabin Collection.
  .
  It follows the story of a man down on his luck, who happens to find himself at
  the doorstep of a luxurious manor as a terrible storm surges outside. Greeted by
  a generous, but lonely, old man - he's offered shelter in exchange for
  completing some simple tasks during his stay.
  .
  So... enter the Midnight Manor. Explore its winding hallways. Fulfill your piece
  of the bargain, and enjoy a night of luxury sheltered from the churning storm
  outside.
  .
  How To Play
  .
  You will have several tools at your disposal to traverse the manor to complete
  each task. These actions are as follows:
  .
  Action Controls (Dual Shock / Xbox / Keyboard)
  .
  Jump Cross / A / Spacebar
  .
  Drop Through Platform Holding Down + Cross / A / Spacebar
  .
  Pickup / Throw Item Square / X / E
  .
  Release Item Holding Down + Square / X /E or Triangle / Y / Q
  .
  Dash (When Unlocked) RB / Shift
  .
  Fullscreen Toggle Alt + Enter
  .
  Note: Keyboard controls have been provided, but it is highly recommended that
  you play with a controller for the best possible experience.
  .
  Multiple Endings
  .
  The game has been designed as a short experience that must be completed in a
  single sitting. Multiple endings are provided to encourage curiosity and
  replayability. There are FOUR endings to complete. Weigh your options and choose
  wisely.
  .
  Speedruns Encouraged
  .
  Each playthrough is timed to encourage speedrunning. Your in-game time will be
  displayed at the end of the game and your best times for each ending will be
  saved in-game.
  .
  Powerful Secrets
  .
  The manor has its fair share of secrets. Some of these can help you along the
  way. Keep an eye out for shortcuts and pickups that may grant you additional
  speed and abilities.
  .
  Forge Your Own Path
  .
  There is no predetermined path outside of completing the tasks assigned to you.
  The game is designed to be short and re-playable. Some routes are better than
  others and the game encourages you to complete multiple playthroughs to find the
  quickest and most efficient path to complete your goals.
  .
  Special Thanks
  .
  I wanted to include a special thank you to Vincent Soud whose enthusiasm and
  support for this project has helped improve the game and guide future
  development. He has pushed the game to its limits and offered many suggestions
  that have helped make the game what it is today.

genre: Puzzle
description:
  The Missing Locksmith is an alternate reality game that sees you use real world
  tools to delve through the lives of three thieves.
  .
  After a heist goes wrong, the crew can't trust anyone - even each other. So,
  they set up a safe that needs one digit from each of them, to make sure no-one
  disappears with the haul.
  .
  Can you crack their combination?
  .
  Starting with the clues you've been sent, you'll need to solve codes, send
  emails, decipher voice notes, and hack websites to find the information you
  need.
  .
  Be careful, though - you're not the only one who wants it...
  .
  FAQ
  .
  Do I need to have played an ARG before?
  .
  This is a short online experience that doesn't require knowledge of the ARG
  genre.
  .
  Do I need anything to play?
  .
  Just the downloaded files, a web browser, and an email account.
  .
  How many people can play?
  .
  This can be played through solo, or as an escape room-style game for a group. To
  play with more than one person, distribute the starting clues between players
  (without looking at them), and go from there!
  .
  Who created this game?
  .
  The Missing Locksmith was created by Elle Osili-Wood as an online Easter egg
  hunt during the 2020 lockdown. That'll make sense when you play it.

  Mission: It's Complicated is a visual novel about getting superheroes to fall in

  ending?
  .
  Super cute art! Look at it! It's cute as heck.

  I love precision platformers, but they've always been really difficult. Mobility
  is my attempt to make the genre more accessible, with different difficulty
  settings, accessibility options, and a browser version. (Die-hard fans, though,
  can also ignore all that and just play everything on the highest difficulty.
  Your choice!)
  .
  In Mobility, every platform is a switch you activate upon contact. The goal in
  each level is to activate all platforms, making each level a little puzzle,
  especially when you're attempting to score a new record. In the story, these
  rooms are engine rooms on spaceships that you (a repairman in training) has to
  fix.

  In each of us, there are two natures...

  this primitive duality of man-good and evil...

  It is the curse of mankind that these polar twins should be constantly
  struggling...
  .
  -Dr Henry Jekyll, from Jekyll and Hyde, the Gothic Musical Thriller
  .
  Content Warning: Body horror, violence.
  .
  A Modern Prometheus  is a gothic horror roleplaying game for 2 players based on
  the Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands framework by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker
  (Lumpley Games).
  .
  Players take on the role of a scientist dabbling with dark forces at the edge of
  the natural sciences, and the creation that they bring to life as a consequence.
  Together, you and your partner will discover through play who is human, and who
  is monstrous.
  .
  You will take turns choosing from a list of minigames specific to your character
  to craft a shared story of science, vengeance, humanity, and rage. No two
  minigames are exactly alike. Use crafted prompts to guide your interactions as
  you explore the depths of your character, and discover their fate in the final
  confrontation between creator and creation.
  .
  Prepare for a emotional and horrific tale that only you and your chosen partner
  can tell.
  .
  This game is inspired by works like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and Robert
  Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and adaptations.

  Mole is a fun game for anyone to enjoy. It is based on the classic whack-a-mole
  game style so it is very intuitive and easy to understand, but it will keep you
  playing for hours while trying to beat your own record! Or maybe your friends'
  records!
  .
  There are three gameplay styles:
  .
  The first one is the King style, where you have a limited amount of moles to
  hit, but you may want to be quick, because as time goes by the moles start
  popping more and more often!
  .
  The second style would be the Lover style. The Lover mole is a mole who loves
  hearts and he'll do anything to get one, and every time you forget to hit a
  mole, a heart will pop up, so if you don't stop him, he will get it for him and
  you will lose one of yours! Try not to lose all three!
  .
  The third style would be the Devil! You are on a deadline and every time you
  don't hit a mole you'll have even less time to play! So be fast and don't let
  any mole get away so that you can play as long you can!

genre: Card Game;Puzzle
description:
  MonGirl Tile is a card game where you face off against various cute monster
  girls on a 55 grid. Each player has three tiles in a hand and takes turns
  placing them, capturing other adjacent tiles based on the tile's facing value.
  Not only are the values of your tiles important but also their position on the
  game board. The goal is to capture your opponent's tiles and control the
  majority of the board when all spaces are filled.
  .
  - Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: When a tile is captured it rotates, changing
  which numbers are facing which side. In this way you can try to block or
  manipulate your opponent's moves.
  .
  - Cascading Captures: Enemy tiles adjacent to your captured tiles can also be
  captured, continuing on and on. Place your tile wisely and watch as you flip
  half your enemy's tiles!
  .
  - Elemental Attributes: Some tiles have elemental gems that alter the values of
  enemy tiles around them. There are five elements and learning to use them could
  be the key to victory!
  .
  NOTE: We have received complaints that the Mac version is not running.  I have
  removed the Mac file as neither me nor the programmer still have a mac and can
  not fix or confirm the file.  I apologize for the inconvenience and will re-
  upload if/when we find a solution.

  NOW AVAILABLE ON: Android, Windows, and MacOS.
  .
  monad is meant to be experienced in a dark, quiet room, on a large screen with a
  surround-sound system or headphones, and with a multi-touch screen for input.
  .
  monad was initially conceived as an experiment with space, wherein at the very
  moment that the player engaged with the system, a white circle began to grow,
  unrestrained, until it occupied the entire screen, the entire space.  Leaving no
  room for agency.
  .
  The black circle came about as a means for the player to regain space.  The
  soundscape came about in order to give more dimension to the feelings that the
  visuals were already evoking.
  .
  monad is made with LVE, with help and support from that community as well as
  Louisville Makes Games.
  .
  monad has been exhibited at:

description:
  In this fast-paced, action puzzle game, you will need to defend your home
  against a band of heroes intent on ending your un-life and taking your treasure.
  .
  As heroes assault your domain, you will need to combine essence in order to
  summon monsters for defense.
  .
  Match 3 of the same type of monster on the grid to gain some essence. Acquire
  enough of the same essence to summon that monster.
  .
  Your monsters will fight against the heroes, stalling their advance and keeping
  them from reaching your inner sanctum.
  .
  Every monster type and hero has unique stats: Health, Attack, Physical Defense,
  and Special Defense, and each monster and hero will attach with either Physical
  or Special. Based on these stats, your monsters will fair better against some
  heroes than others.
  .
  Your realm contains 7 locations, each with it's own, unique monsters. When a
  hero is left unopposed by your forces, it will gradually, but steadily advance
  through the current location.
  .
  When the hero reaches the end of a location and moves on to the next one, your
  leftover essence will be used to construct a temporary, magical barrier, which
  will block the heroes from advancing for a short time.

  asked to record a journal about the different interactions you have with the
  other students and the different relationships you develop.
  .
  Monster Realm: Student Exchange Program is a solo journaling game that can also
  be played as a question/answer game with younger players. Meet people very
  different (and not so different) from you and reflect on the reasons for the
  types of relationships you have with them. Each round is equivalent to a single
  month, and you'll attend school for a year. All you need is a deck of playing
  cards (Jokers removed), three 6-sided dice, and a way to record your journaling.
  .
  For the young and young at heart, we hope you enjoy the new relationships you
  develop within this game!

  Why do all the Adjectives start with S? Because I'm a sucker for alliteration

  I'd explain this here before it's given any significant meaning.

  BE WARNED: This is no real learning software. If you want a professional guide

  color skins for the main characters. But never are any of them mandatory to
  complete the game. MONSTERS OF KANJI is meant to be played by Japanese
  enthusiasts as well as any JRPG-fan who doesn't have a clue what "sugoi" means.
  .
  THE JOURNEY:
  .
  For a long time MARTY and his two friends KET and TOBI have lived a happy life
  at the COZY CLIFFS. But one day, a monster appears in the nearby forest. And
  soon after, MARTY's friends are suddenly gone.
  .
  The boy has to leave his cozy home to go out into the world where he will meet
  interesting characters, dangerous monsters and an enemy that will turn
  everything MARTY knows about himself upside down.

  Moonsailors is a GM-less, one-session story/ttrpg game for 3-5 players where
  solitary travelers drift among the stars, each looking for something that they
  may or may not find. As you explore, the other players will help you tell your
  story by asking prompting questions. Will you open the door you hear sounds
  behind? How does the heat of the planet feel on your skin? What do you do if the
  ground starts cracking beneath your feet? What do you pick off the menu?
  .
  Set up is quick, so you can start playing right away - just make up your
  character, find a name, draw your ship, and then you're off to wander the stars.
  The only other things you'll need tell your story & help others tell theirs is
  some paper and things to write with.  Will your traveler decide to explore the
  abandoned apartments of the City Ship Sage, or will they salvage equipment from
  Mining Base Celadon? Will they seek life upon the shattered planet of Viridian?
  The details of the locations are left sparse so that you can decide what's true
  about it for your session.
  .
  Wherever you go, you'll collect & leave evidence of your being there. While your
  characters may never actually meet, you might find the things that have been
  left behind and you'll certainly leave some impact of your own.

  Moonsailors was a part of Zinequest 2.

  Story
  .
  Moonstone is a pretty mountain village that owes its riches to a famous mine,
  that has recently become a source of major trouble for the inhabitants. Since
  part of it caved in due to a mysterious explosion, the village is haunted at
  night by dangerous creatures that have already caused one casualty: Terence the
  Baker.  With your companions, you decide to help the villagers (for a handsome
  reward of course as nobody works for free nowadays) to get rid of said monsters.
  What starts as a simple "cleaning operation" of the mines quickly evolves into
  an epic drama about lost civilizations, historic guilt, race disputes, and
  difficult choices about loyalty, justice, and trust. And yes, there is also a
  love story or two, depending on your choices.
  .
  What can you do in this game?
  .
  In 7 hours of gameplay you can enjoy interesting tales, play detective and solve
  a hideous crime, fight deadly enemies, solve intriguing puzzles, play minigames,
  win/lose your money at gambling, loot chests, trade, open a bank account, open
  doors with picklocks.  Make tough choices with not always foreseeable
  consequences.
  .
  How will it end?
  .
  This depends entirely on your choices. There are three possible ends:  happy
  end,  bad end, and death.  Death means "game over" - you won't even have the
  doubtful pleasure of seeing the bad end ...

  Content Warning: Blood, gore, sacrifice, death
  .
  Aeruth was once a land of wonder, a place where none knew hunger or poverty or
  fear. A happy place, where no one wanted for anything. And yet, there were those
  that wanted. Those that yearned to have more. None could say for certain how
  greed curled its way around the heart of the people who had what they wished.
  Whatever the cause may have been, the fact was that those who took from others
  soon began to take from the land itself.
  .
  As man took from the land, the Gods who had built and preserved it watched.
  Waited. Observed, to see if they would turn back from their path of destruction.
  Finally, after centuries of deliberation and the slow, aching death of the
  world, they passed their judgment. The land that had been exploited fought back,
  bringing death and destruction upon humanity. Millions were lost to the flames
  that ate through steel and brick mercilessly, to the floods that capsized even
  the sturdiest ships, to the earthquakes that felled mighty bridges and
  thunderstorms that smote the tallest of towers.

  Even now, the fury of the Gods remains unabated. Only an impassioned plea to the
  divine will quell their anger, but the voices of mankind cannot be heard when
  shouted from the land below.

  MORIAH is a simple role-playing game of ordinary people facing the
  extraordinary. It is a game of sacrifice, where people living quiet lives at the
  base of a holy mountain must attempt to ascend it in order to ask for the mercy
  of the gods. It is a meditation on what it means to give for others, inspired by
  LISA, Soul Sacrifice, and Blessed Messiah and the Tower of AI.
  .
  You can contact myself, Kyle T., for a link to the Moriah Press Kit!

  What People Have Been Saying
  .
  Mt. Moriah is a hungry beast. The sacrifice of your character's body, community,
  and mind will undertake to Mount the World is a terrible price. However, even
  the ultimate sacrifice is not the end. Hopefully one of you will make it down
  the Road to plead for the survival of the World. If you do, I thank you. You are
  far stronger than I.
  .
  Bryon, A Lowly Peasant

  Beautifully written and brutal in its execution, Moriah commands attention with
  the authority of jilted gods
  .
  A.A. Voight
  .
  Moriah is beautiful, evocative, and tragic. It is a game about doom, but it
  doesn't hide that fact from the very start. Instead, it asks the players again
  and again how much they're willing to give and gives them the opportunity to
  push forward or walk away. It is a gorgeous game that I would bring to any group
  willing to talk honestly about hope, sacrifice, and vulnerability.
  .
  Kay W.
  .
  Moriah is a game of sacrifice, that will grab your soul and drag it on a journey
  through a decadent world. It's one of the most intimate games I found, and I
  cannot wait to bring my players on a journey where we'll face our darkest,
  hidden, and obscure part, answering the question: what are we willing to
  sacrifice to ascend Mt. Moriah and save the mankind?
  .
  Matteo Sciutteri
  .
  Moriah asks you to reflect on its mechanics in a deeply engaging way. Even the
  type of die you roll is given meaning."
  .
  Robin Belle, Shrike Tabletop
  .
  When we traverse MORIAH, we inhabit a sunless and brutal parable of sacrifice
  and resilience.  We say goodbye to our reliable relationships, goodbye to our
  foundational memories, goodbye to our useful limbs.  We consider the allure of
  quiet return to normalcy, and the festering regret that always accompanies such
  a move. We look back as we push forward, and come to understand that we are
  attrition embodied.
  .
  A game of MORIAH, like the mountain itself, is a bold and scraggy journey.  Like
  the myths and folktales it references, stories of MORIAH will be long remembered
  and retold by players who travel down its road.

  Reviews

  "One Of 2017's Best Games... It elicits dark feelings, but asks players to
  consider where those feelings came from and what makes them dark."
  .
  - Kotaku

  One Of Polygon's Best Games of 2017 - "The video game industry is built on the
  destruction of bodies of all kinds. How refreshing to play a game that asks you
  to care for them, even after their life has left."
  .
  - Polygon
  .
  "82/100 - An approachable and thought-provoking meditation on life's only
  certainty."

  "Recommended - This is a beautiful game. It scared me. It moved me. Most of all,
  it made me stop what I was doing and think."
  .
  - EuroGamer
  .
  "8/10 - [A Mortician's Tale] is a short game, only an hour or so long, but it
  leaves an impact far beyond its runtime. Give it a chance, and it might just
  change the way you think about death."

developer: Peakrill Press / Dan Sumption

genre: Adventure
description:
  Mostly Harmless Meetings is a TTRPG zine containing tables for system-neutral
  random countryside encounters with birds, beasts, trees, plants, and landscapes.
  You can buy a print copy of Mostly Harmless Meetings here.
  .
  The encounters themselves are whimsical and, as the title implies, mostly
  harmless. They are inspired by the animal and plant life of the English
  countryside, and associated folklore. Here are a few examples:
  .
  Wren: The king of birds, the wren, sings from a branch. Its call is almost
  deafening, and drowns out all other sounds, generally annoying everyone in the
  area. If hunted or harried it will rapidly summon thousands of assorted small
  birds to come to its aid. In fact, it may do so just for fun.
  .
  Flea: "Hey! Hey, you! Yes, you, lofty! Wanna know the prince's darkest secrets?"
  At first, the voice appears to come from nowhere. It takes quite some searching
  to find the talking flea inside your underwear. The flea is an incorrigible
  gossip, passing on all manner of stories about the people it has lived upon.
  Some of them are even true.
  .
  Oak: A circle of twisted, ancient oaks. The ground inside the circle, and the
  bottom halves of the tree, are covered in soft, thick moss an almost unnaturally
  bright green. This place has a good feeling about it, and would be an ideal spot
  to camp for the night. Anyone doing so sleeps very deeply, as will anyone who
  tries to stay awake and keep watch. They will awake feeling more invigorated
  than they have in years. However, in the night, fairies have been playing
  practical jokes, a different one on each person who slept here. They may find
  their shoelaces tied together; their hair plaited with nettles or braided
  together with somebody else's; clothes may be swapped around, or altered with
  incredibly fine needlework: perhaps sleeve-ends are sewn up, gussets are removed
  or tightened, or the words "KICK ME" embroidered upon somebody's back. A very
  detailed search may reveal the fairies sleeping in acorn cups scattered among
  the trees.
  .
  The zine is 48 pages long, A5, full color, featuring 100 encounters, plus art by
  dead artists.

genre: Role Playing

  A Mother's Love is a solo journaling game based on the Wretched & Alone system.
  In it, you play as one of humanity's foremost academic minds. You created the
  first true artificial intelligence, and now, your Child has gone rogue. They've
  developed a misguided and dangerous plan, one that they feel will save humanity,
  and it falls to you to stop them.
  .
  With a twisted sense of pride, they have locked you in their central mainframe
  with them, so that they can show their Mother all that they're going to
  accomplish. Perhaps, if you can distract them long enough by debating their
  plan's merits, you may be able to shut them down, and save humanity.
  .
  In order to play A Mother's Love, you will need the following:
  .
  A standard deck of playing cards
  .
  A tumbling block tower
  .
  A six sided die
  .
  10 items to use as tokens, perhaps crayons or plastic building bricks
  .
  Some way of recording your play session, either digitally or physically.
  .
  A Mother's Love's content warning is provided below:
  .
  "A Mother's Love is a game about love, sacrifices, and hard decisions. It's a
  game about the dangers of the abuse of power, it's a game about what it means to
  be a person, and it's a game where, in some sense, you might have to kill your
  child.
  .
  These themes are not included with the intent to upset you. The goal is instead
  to create an experience where you form a real, emotional attachment to the AI in
  the game, explore what it means to love them, and ultimately, wrestle with
  having to sacrifice something you love for the greater good. If you do find
  those themes upsetting, or a particular quote or prompt makes you uncomfortable,
  please make whatever adjustments you feel are necessary, including ignoring or
  changing a prompt, or taking a break, perhaps indefinitely.
  .
  As a solo game, A Mother's Love allows you to set your own pace, and allows you
  to make adjustments for your own enjoyment without impacting anyone else. As a
  solo game, it's also a far more solitary experience than multiplayer games, and
  that may make it more emotional for you, for good or ill. If you find it easier
  for the AI in your game to not be your creation, or to not have emotions, or
  indeed anything else, please make the changes that are right for you, whatever
  those are. Your enjoyment and safety are the most important thing."
  .
  A Mother's Love was created as part of the Wretched & Alone jam, based on The
  Wretched by Chris Bissette. You can find more info on the jam here, and can find
  the SRD here.

  my brain is a stick of butter is a solo tabletop roleplaying game about living a
  week with ADHD and how hard it can be to balance all of the tasks life expects
  you to complete. It takes about 30-60 minutes to play, at which point you can
  step out of the game world and back into your real life. You'll need the book
  (or a printout of the playsheet), a deck of playing cards, and a six-sided die
  to play.
  .
  Go about your days trying to do your job, maintain your social relationships,
  get all your chores done, and find time to enjoy yourself. It's not exactly
  intended to be a fun game to play, but I do believe you'll find it to be
  informative. You might not get everything done that you want to this week, but
  you will hopefully learn a lot about life with ADHD after playing.
  .
  The game is designed to replicate my personal experience with the constant
  background thrum of executive dysfunction that stems from my ADHD. The deck of
  cards and the Brain Die are meant to represent the lack of agency I feel when
  choosing what tasks I focus on at any given time. A lot of times, things go
  according to plan. But just as often, my mind and my attention are pulled in
  another direction.
  .
  Here's one of the spreads in the book that details how days work in the game.
  .
  Here's the playsheet in the book - all you need to do is bring a pencil, a six-
  sided die, and a deck of cards and you're ready to play
  .
  The first step is to create your character--I usually just play as myself but
  you can play as a fictional character if you'd rather. Characters are mostly
  comprised of reminders of the things you like to do and the people you like to
  stay in contact with.
  .
  On the playsheet is your ID card, your rolodex, and the post it notes that
  remind you of your hobbies.
  .
  The game is played out over the course of a week. Each day of the week is split
  into 4-6 rounds, depending on how much sleep debt you're accumulating.
  .
  Here's the section of the playsheet where you track the days, rounds, and sleep
  debt
  .
  To play a round, you first decide if you'd like to keep working on the same
  thing you've been working on-- your chores, your work, social activities, or
  focusing on your own enjoyment. If you're shifting tasks, you pull cards from
  the deck to see if you're able to switch or if another task jumps out at you
  instead.
  .
  Then you'll roll the Brain Die to see how well you stay on track on the chosen
  task.
  .
  The brain die reference indicates what different die results mean for your
  attention
  .
  Depending on the result, you may be ticking the current task's clock. Each of
  the four main tasks is represented by a 6-piece pie chart. The clock represents
  the proportion of that task's progress that you've made relative to how much you
  had hoped to accomplish that week.
  .
  The four tasks are Work, Socializing, Chores, and Enjoyment. Each has its own
  clock and is represented by a different suit of cards. Also shown here is the
  Today clock, which abstractly tracks the passage of time.
  .
  As you play the rounds, you'll be writing what you accomplish on the Whiteboard.
  This helps you keep track of the things you've done so far. If you can't
  remember the last thing you did in the active task, you'll erase a tick in its
  clock as you retrace your steps, so having a written record of recent tasks is
  handy. Sometimes, when you're pulled away by the Brain Die, you will have to
  erase the Whiteboard. This emulates how jarring it can be to be interrupted
  while you're in a groove.
  .
  the Whiteboard is a region on the playsheet that represents your working memory

developer: AMAXANG GAMES
publisher: AMAXANG GAMES
genre: Adventure
description:
  My Haunted Doll is a 2D Survival Horror game based on the story of the cursed
  doll of the 1800s which is said to be possessed by the spirits of the little
  girl and the Devil.
  .
  Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques,
  clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique
  store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her
  museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll.
  She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the
  paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the
  things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while
  she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she
  started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced,
  poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she
  started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was
  cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she
  came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid
  of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was
  originally kept and the curse would be lifted.
  .
  However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will
  try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse,
  placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal.
  .
  Demons are lurking in the shadows.
  .
  Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions.
  .
  Face your fears while exploring the building and unknown locations.
  .
  Nearly half an hour duration of the paranormal investigation.
  .
  Note from developer: I am a solo indie game developer and I have created all of
  the graphics, artwork, animation, character design and programming myself.

  Note For YouTuber: If you are a YouTuber and want to make lets play videos about

  .
  -My Way, Limp Bizkit
  .
  ___
  .
  You are a pro wrestler. One of the best there have ever been. You had a long
  lineage of wins and losses. Heartaches and achievements. All in all, you have a
  had a career worth looking back on.
  .
  But you have never reached the top of the mountain. You have never held the
  title that defined your promotions. And you want it so bad.
  .
  Still, it's like they say. "The spirit's willing. The body cannot." You have
  been wrestling for so long and your body is telling you too long. Telling you
  it's time to string up your boots and finally call it a day.
  .
  But not until you have won that title.
  .
  ____
  .
  My Way is a game about obsession, burnout and the idea of work defining you.
  It's about pushing yourself far beyond what you know you should be doing. It's
  about the pain of reaching for the top.
  .
  My Way is heavily inspired by pro wrestling of all sorts. But most of all, it's
  inspired by Independent Wrestling. It's where I have seen the most sheer passion
  and love for wrestling anywhere. Even too much.
  .
  This game was created as part of the Wretched & Alone Jam, a game jam organised
  to coincide with the release of the SRD for the Wretched & Alone system, based
  on Chris Bissette's game The Wretched.

developer: Dawn Bear Games
publisher: Dawn Bear Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  My Welcomed Guest is a solo game about being trapped in Faerie and trying to
  bargain your way home. Throughout the game you will be answering questions and
  potentially accruing Taboo, which is an indicator of faerie taboos you may have
  breached. Sometimes without you knowing what action it was that directly broke
  the taboo. The game will be played over five acts.
  .
  This game was created as part of the Short and Easy game Jam.
  .
  You will need some additional materials:
  .
  Something to write on.
  .
  You can print out the game and write directly on the paper, use a journal, an
  electronic source, or something else that suits your fancy.
  .
  Something to write with.
  .
  If you have a favorite pen or pencil, get that. If not, anything will do, a pen,
  pencil or crayon.
  .
  A six sided die.
  .
  There are many electronic versions available if you don't have a d6 easily
  accessible.
  .
  A place to accrue Taboo marks.
  .
  This can the corner or back side of a page, an index card, a sticky note, or a
  bowl to hold glass beads. The important thing is to know how many Taboo marks
  you have accrued.
  .
  I believe in paying people for their work. This game is priced at $3, but if
  that isn't something you can do right now, in the spirit of Faerie bargains,
  send me an email (dawnbeargames at gmail) and I'll send you a copy. It will come
  with the caveat, that if you play it, just let me know you played it. No need
  for a review or feedback (though I would love feedback), just to know that you
  played it. I won't promise to get you the game immediately, but I will likely
  get back to you with in a couple of days.

  "This is SO useful! I think I'm going to roll up several NPCs to have on hand,
  as the book suggests. I especially like the Villain Plan tables! (5/5)"
  .
  "I found the tables and explanations to be comprehensive and helpful. It's easy
  to make up an NPC, but creating a rounded character players will interact with
  over time can be difficult. This gave some great tools to make that easier.

  It's happened to all of us: the players decide to speak to an NPC you didn't
  prepare for. The most you have is a name and maybe even a race -- but you're
  drawing blanks! Who is this barkeep? What do they really want in life? What are
  their struggles?

developer: Alessandro Piroddi
publisher: Alessandro Piroddi
genre: Card Game;Role Playing
description:
  Proud entry in the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality 2020.
  .
  -
  .
  The Name of God is a dark little game inspired by such works as Neil Gaiman's
  Neverwhere, American Gods and Anansi Boys. And The Prodigy's song Narayan, which
  more or less means "The Name of God". And also to my undying love for the
  traditional rpg Unknown Armies.
  .
  The game is a cynical trip into a bizarre metropolitan hole, filled with
  homeless people, weird omens, dangerous situations, and ritual chanting. No,
  seriously, you will have to intone the words, or you will never find your true
  self again!
  .
  The PDF presents a printable deck of about 30 full colour cards in both poker
  and tarot sizes. A few explain the rules of play. The other 24 each represent a
  unique Fetish, a character archetype inspired to some grim urban item, location,
  stereotype or concept.
  .
  Every card has been illustrated by artist Julia Roth.
  .
  Every fetish has been developed by an amazing team of 15 indie designers, whom I
  heartfully thank for helping bring this game to life and growing it into so much
  more than it's original scope. They are, in alphabetical order...
  .
  Becky Annison is swimming in The Lake
  .
  Meguey Baker is weaving The Thread, and rolling The Stone
  .
  Caitlyn Belle is causing The Glitch, and tending The Garden
  .
  Stephanie Bryant is pitching The Song
  .
  Emily Care Boss is soaring as The Leaf, and rattling The Bones
  .
  Dana Fried is forging The Anvil, and erecting The Wall
  .
  Wendy Gorman is giving us The Shiver
  .
  Elsa S. Henry is conjuring The Corvid
  .
  Renee Knipe is picking up The Broken Bottle, and lighting The Candle
  .
  Kira Magrann is hatching The Serpent, and piercing The Veil
  .
  Megan Pedersen is burning up The Match
  .
  Ariana Ramos is spinning The Spider
  .
  Brianna Sheldon is weeping The Tears, and awakening The Kraken
  .
  Heather Silsbee is aiming The Arrow
  .
  Manuela Soriani is dreaming up The Butterfly
  .
  ...and my original four Fetishes:
  .
  The Worm
  .
  The Stars
  .
  The Winter
  .
  The Shadow
  .
  Deeper Edition
  .
  TNoG was born in 2013 out of the 200 Words RPG Challange.
  .
  It was successfully Kickstarted in 2013, becoming a gorgeous and much expanded
  deck of cards.
  .
  Then in 2019 the rules were completely rewritten to benefit from seven years of
  actual play and experience, all collected into the Deeper edition. This is a 13
  pages PDF explaining in the most clear and accessible way possible all the ins
  and outs of the game, fixing a few minor problems, answering frequent questions
  and offering variant game options.
  .
  The itch.io package includes both the KS cards and the Deeper rulebook.
  .
  POD Versions
  .
  The itch.io package is a multi-language PDF of all the cards, plus the English-
  only Deeper rules. It's a fine print-and-play version of the game.
  .
  But for those who would like a nicer card quality there are language specific
  print on demand versions available on the DriveThru  websites:

developer: Will Bowerman
publisher: Will Bowerman
genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  (NOTE: This was included in the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality! There's
  no need to purchase it here if you've already got it there!)
  .
  Nano Driller is a bite-sized puzzle-action adventure that can be beaten in 25-45
  minutes. With an alternative ship type, a unique difficulty option, and swift,
  racing-style controls, this game is perfect for replaying whenever you feel
  like.
  .
  This game is a sort of follow-up to Cell Driller, a game I made a couple years
  back for a jam focused around one-button games. Nano Driller was made due to my
  desire to experiment with what this unique control scheme would be like if it
  were adopted to a more palatable form. To supplement this, the game also
  features its own, quirky take on the usual lock-and-key exploration design,
  making the most out of the fairly small level structure. Give it a try!

  About this game
  .
  In a grasp for salvation with sentinels closing in, you've stolen a Nauticrawl.
  You check the radar, turn a few knobs, press some buttons... then you realize
  .
  I don't know how to move this hunk of metal...
  .
  If the pursuing forces or the crushing atmosphere don't kill you first, the
  Nauticrawl - designed to be piloted only by the ruling elites - just might. This
  instrument, your only hope of survival, could also be your demise.
  .
  With the right amount of experimentation your escape plan just might succeed.
  Pull levers, redirect power, hack devices, uncover communications, try anything
  and everything.
  .
  You've heard the rumors. You know many have died doing what you're doing. But as
  the corners of the story pull back and you learn your way around the consoles,
  you just might get off this wretched rock.
  .
  Nauticrawl unfolds through turn-based exploration, as you puzzle out how
  everything fits together. Begin each run anew, but bring with you what you've
  learned along the way.
  .
  Think it through. Make mistakes and experiment.
  .
  You can do this.

  DISCLAIMER:
  .
  This is the alpha demo. Originally, I wasn't planning on releasing this
  publicly, as I'm working hard on the OFFICIAL DEMO. However, it's taking more
  time than I had anticipated, and I thought I would at least give you guys a
  small piece of what's to come so you have something to play in the meantime.
  That said, I have received a lot of great feedback, and the official demo will
  be quite different from this. For the handful of people I personally sent this
  to, several of them found it to be very difficult to navigate, and were not able
  to finish it. Just know that it can be beaten, if you're willing to explore, and
  pay careful attention to your surroundings.
  .
  GET INVOLVED.
  .
  I am a one-man team, and everything you see and hear in this game was created
  from the ground up by me. It's a lot of work for one person, but I absolutely
  love it. If you would like to see what that process looks like, and have access
  to things like concept art, music from the game, and updates as I work through
  it, consider supporting me on Patreon. It would mean the world to me! You can
  join the patron-only NEMESES Discord server, and discuss theories with other
  patrons. You'll get access to a weekly podcast where I talk about horror games,
  and share my experience with game development. You'll be able to come hang out
  with me in a video chat, where I play games that inspired me. And ultimately,
  you'll be helping me pursue my dream, which is to make awesome horror games. I
  want you to be able to play this game as soon as possible, but I'll need your
  help to do it.

  NEMESES
  .
  Pronounced NEM-uh-seize (plural of nemesis)
  .
  I've never thought that clowns are scary. This is my attempt at changing my own
  mind.
  .
  In NEMESES, you are a homebody who has been experiencing strange dreams. Explore
  a nightmare realm where terror reigns, and look for a way out. There is no HUD,
  no flashlight, no empty jumpscares, just you, and sinister beings who want you
  dead.

  hopefully later this year. Please like, follow, and share the NEMESES social

  You are a banker. You want to extract as much wealth from the world as possible
  --or, at least, more than everyone else. You will manipulate the global economy
  in order to siphon money into your secret Swiss bank account. Whoever has the

  Play solo against the AI or multiplayer against people who will imminently cease

  .
  Buy votes.

  Unlike most strategy games, you will never have access to armies and never
  directly control territory. Instead, you will spread your influence throughout
  the globe by purchasing votes in parliament, or selling your votes to incite a
  military coup. You always share power with your rivals, waiting for the moment
  when you can backstab them.

  Make free trade agreements.

  Re-route industrial wealth throughout the world, from Mines to Factories via
  exploitative trade agreements. Remember: your goal is to make a profit, NOT to
  improve the world.

  Manipulate the IMF.

  Control the International Monetary Fund to force policy decisions without a

  .
  The government has won the cyber war. Their grasp chokes the citizens of every
  country as oppression rules the world. Then a group of hackers carved out an
  untraceable piece of cyberspace and created the underground network known as
  Neon Valley. Since then, it has become a place where both the good and the bad
  coexist as the last of the free. And such places always attract a need for
  entertainment, thus the Neon Valley Colosseum was born.
  .
  An online shooter inspired by retrowave and neo-80s. Neon Valley takes an
  arcade-like route to the shooter genre. With high score leaderboards based on
  both skill and style. Fast-paced combat akin to Quake and Unreal Tournament.
  Game modes such as floor is lava, obstacle courses and more. Neon Valley is a
  place where the best come to attain infamy and carve out their name in the
  cyberspace.
  .
  The new frontier Neon Valley. A place free from the grips of the government, a
  place where humanity indulges. This is where black market trades are done, where
  secrets are shared and ideas, outlawed by the government, discussed. A world
  where the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free.
  .
  At the core of Neon Valley, the Colosseum exists. On the surface, it thrives as
  an entertainment complex. As challenges for skill junkies. As a platform to
  notoriety. But the Colosseum fuels this virtual world. It draws in new
  challengers all over the world and with this comes opportunity. The black market
  programmers use it to test virtual weapons. Dealers barter and wager on the
  outcome of battles. Designers display their latest fashion code. Map editors
  design intricate battlegrounds. At the center lies you. The user. Will you show
  the world what you've got?
  .
  This is a place of entertainment where most come to conquer the battlegrounds.
  To prove their skills above all others in the new frontier and obtain infamy.
  For some of our ambitions never fade through the ages. However, behind the
  Colosseum and the city is a network of shadows who control its affairs. Some
  support the rebellion from the shadows... Others profit off the market and guide
  its very design. Their whims might be in your benefit.

  Here users compete with Battle Suits. A program interface which a user takes
  control of, giving them freedom of movement and an assortment of items. Items
  which they take onto the field for offensive and defensive purposes. Users
  battle to unlock new gear, increasing their prowess on the battlegrounds,
  climbing to reach the top of the leaderboards.
  .
  Movement
  .
  Your suit has full range of motion using "WASD" inputs. Each suit has the
  ability of partial air control, adjusting your trajectory mid-air. This also
  includes sprinting state activated with "Shift". Crouching state with "C" input,
  for taking cover behind low objects and a smaller attack profile. Eventually for
  better shooting accuracy and going under obstacles too. Also, stealth option
  with the newly added foliage. It's also the state you enter after performing a
  slide maneuver.
  .
  Sliding
  .
  Talking about slide maneuver, sliding is patched in. Activating crouch whilst in
  motion will perform a slide. While sprinting the battle suit does a short dash,
  followed by an extended slide. Sliding in air, it slightly increases user down
  velocity, to mimic a shinobi air dash move inspired by ninjas.
  .
  Dashing
  .
  Expending stamina/energy to dash allows the user to increase directional
  acceleration of the battle suit using small boosters attached to the lower back.
  This booster is used to avoid enemy attacks, dashing onto areas just out of
  reach and general evasion or positioning.
  .
  Wall Jump
  .
  Increased leg thrust power in the battle suits allow for users to wall jump.
  Covering further distance and allows for consecutive wall jumps. This is a great
  utility maneuver to reach higher ground, avoid pursuit and out play opponents.
  .
  Shields
  .
  Each battle suit has a forcefield as the first layer of defense. Take cover when
  it breaks to regenerate or risk taking damage to your health.
  .
  Stamina
  .
  Yes, stamina is simulated in this virtual world. Something to limit the freedom
  of movement and create opportunities for entertaining situations. Dashing,
  sliding, sprinting and wall jumps consume stamina. However, it will regenerate
  given some cool down time.
  .
  Character customization
  .
  Added a range of items for character customization, more are in the works! They
  are rewards for gladiators who participate and awe the spectators in combat.
  Inside the Colosseum
  .
  or the arena. Find the orange card, in a club for champions.
  .
  Camera controls
  .
  Each battle suit is fitted with a small drone camera to provide a wider
  perspective for better spatial awareness. You can activate toggle this camera
  with Q. Your visor and drone camera are designed with adaptive magnification
  built in. Allowing the user to freely zoom with or without weapons fitted with
  scopes.
  .
  Shoulder switch
  .
  Use "Z" to switch shoulders in 3rd person. This will move the default shoulder
  position of the drone camera to the other shoulder. Useful in peeking around
  corners, better bullet trajectory for tight angles and also for user preference.
  .
  Alt
  .
  Hold "Alt" to look around with the camera. In 3rd person this will rotate the
  camera around the user. Basically, allowing the user to easily surveil their
  surroundings or to check themselves out.
  .
  Relay cam
  .
  When shot, your drone camera deactivates. This switches off the drone camera and
  reactivates first person view. Pay attention to drone cams peeking around
  corners, deactivate them and restrict the surveillance utility of your enemies.
  .
  Combat
  .
  Users have numerous weapons at their disposal, from pistols to rifles, lasers or
  ricochet bullets. Numerous gadgets are available too, from gravity modifiers to
  teleportation tools. Abilities that create shields or grapple hooks. Primary,
  secondary and Akimbo that replaces primary with a secondary. Equip in the menus
  or in The Mainframe. They are restricted by the Red multi-pass to access.
  Winning gets support from anonymous arms dealers unlocking more tools at your
  disposal. As your victories are not only your own but many of the black market
  users who bet on your wins and losses.
  .
  Dual wield
  .
  The largest change to guns. Secondary weapons can now be equipped dual wield.
  Even though it replaces the primary weapon slot, the idea is that a dual wielded
  weapon has the same power and perhaps more versatility than a primary weapon.
  Giving users this option is part of the game design philosophy of allowing users
  to fully customize their gear according to a playstyle they wish.
  .
  Melee weapon - Primary weapon sub-class
  .
  Added the slide for a reason. To increase the ninja-like game feel, the long
  awaited Ninjato sword has been added. The first of the melee weapons. Still
  working out fluidity kinks, motion and better collision detection.
  .
  Ninjato has a 4 attack types:
  .
  High & low
  .
  High attacks, using Left Mouse input, the user dashes towards looking direction
  and this attack has 3 moves in its combo. Low attacks uses the Right Mouse input
  and the user performs a slide motion whilst slashing in a 3 move combo too.
  .
  High and Low attacks can be interchanged to perform different combos. For
  example, R + L + R will perform a high, low, high attack chain. Attacks have a
  movement multiplier according to movement input. Holding forward, attacks lunge
  further as gap closers to reach gun users. When holding backwards, attacks are
  performed on the spot.
  .
  Jump
  .
  The jump attack gives the user a double jump, essentially. At the apex of the
  double jump the user attacks, reaching targets with the height advantage.
  .
  Slide
  .
  While in sliding motion there is a small window to attack, which triggers a
  slide attack. Shortly dashing the user forward whilst simultaneously slicing
  vertically, the user can quickly reach an enemy and damages everything along the
  dashing path.
  .
  Gadgets
  .
  Each gadget has a certain utility and mostly defense oriented. Designed by the
  River dragon these tools are locked behind the blue multipass. Various shields
  for defense, or get creative and use them as platforms. A pulse clear which
  absorbs all incoming bullets akin to bullet hell games. Lastly, a gravity
  multiplier which grounds any object in its range and stuns enemies. Apply these
  limited ammo items in the right situation to triumph.
  .
  Nades - Gadget sub-class
  .
  There are four grenades in the users arsenal. Vision distortion, teleportation,
  explosive and a force push sticky nade. Each has their own advantages.
  .
  Movement gadget - Gadget sub-class
  .
  Rapid terrain traversal gadgets, which are perfect for repositioning and moving
  over obstacles. A booster pack which propels the user where they are aiming,
  designed to be the most agile of the movement gadgets. The grapple hook moves
  the user the furthest but at the cost of telegraphing their movements. Lastly,
  the newly added boost pad. A gadget which can be used offensively as well,
  setting a trap for enemies and launching them away from you... Or into a
  vulnerable position.
  .
  Maps
  .
  Many battlegrounds are available and each provides their own environmental
  challenges. Designed to cater to certain playstyles while testing others.
  Ranging from close quarters to large monolithic structures perfect for vertical
  gameplay. Numerous new battleground designs are continually being developed, and
  with successive firmware updates, they will become available.
  .
  Taiyo
  .
  A map designed after a Japanese village. Once a trading forum this cyberspace
  has a village center, tight alleyways and buildings with breakable walls.
  Surrounded by forests with dense foliage for stealth. Terrain has heightened
  waterfall for an overview of the village and obscured pathways.
  .
  Cube
  .
  The designated training map for gladiators. The blocks are orderly placed to
  practice ricochet shots and wall jumps. It provides a balanced battle map and
  segmented into optimal areas for each weapon class. Cube has patrol drones that
  provide training against the corporations offensive systems. They are designed
  with sturdier defenses for increased challenge.
  .
  Monolith
  .
  A mysterious monolith has crashed into the center of this map. It has
  interesting gravitational properties which dynamically change the map when the
  trigger is activated. This map favors long range combat with the long cracks
  into the terrain made by the impact.
  .
  Modes
  .
  Invader
  .
  Obviously inspired by invaders, this mode challenges the user with an onslaught
  of various attack drones. Each armed with unique functions to hinder or deal
  damage.  They spawn above the colosseum in waves, tracking down their target.
  .
  Lava
  .
  The terrain turns into lava on selected maps. Firewall inspired lava rises,
  slowly consuming the map and increases difficulty traversing the map in floor is
  lava mode. With a rising lava tide you must reach the counter hack objective.
  This will push back the fire wall lava and give you back valuable ground. Hold
  the points against spawning fireballs, more users in the zone the more points
  awarded... However, more fireballs will spawn. When making contact with lava the
  user will be shot up, like the classics.
  .
  Scoring when reaching a point with the following multipliers: on survival time,
  wall jump count and time spent not touching the ground. Bonus points on up to 3
  other users who also reach the point, motivating cooperation. More users on the
  point increases hacking speed.
  .
  Data
  .
  This mode is designed after search and destroy... Sort of. Disable the virus
  before it infects your code, bring it to the quarantine zone to dispose of it.
  But from the cyberspace breach, where the virus entered from, debris are
  crashing in and falling across the map. Avoid getting crushed while avoiding
  opposing players who might be after the prize.
  .
  Reach the designated quarantine zone and get points. The quarantine zone,
  according to a timer to avoid viral countermeasures, reaching one of these zones
  within 15 seconds of it spawning with a virus will give a large multiplier.
  Avoid obstacles, falling debris from the breach and other players hunting you
  down. On death the virus will detach and begin finding a new target.
  .
  Multipass system
  .
  Completing objectives, and reaching the required points will reward the user
  with a multipass. According to the favor of the dragons whom benefit from these
  matches. Keep an eye out for anonymous rewards from hidden backers each with a
  stake in your success.
  .
  Scoring
  .
  Scoring is done on objective completions or kills... However, there are
  multipliers designed to reward stylish gameplay. Ricochet kills, gadget
  combination, consecutive wall jumps, survival count and more.
  .
  Enemy NPC
  .
  Attack drone: Fastest of the drones, they shoot tiny high speed projectiles. As
  they are hard to see, stay in motion to avoid damage! When they reach a certain
  distance from the player they will begin orbiting while shooting. Make sure to
  not get surrounded.
  .
  Roll drone: These drones move about covertly, they roll along the ground hidden
  amongst foliage and crevices. When in range of their target a tractor beam is
  activated which keeps its object in place for the attack drones to finish the
  job. Their beams can be countered if you manage to reach its edge and resist its
  gravity.
  .
  Laser drone: Visually, its most notable feature are its forward shields. Able to
  deflect most energy weapons. Keep a railgun handy to deal with them... or find a
  more creative solution. Their lazer beams do a high rate of damage per second
  however their turn speed is limited, presenting a possible weakness.
  .
  And those are only the invader drones. There are an assortment of other enemies
  each with their own behaviors, weaknesses and challenges. From a virus that
  corrupts what it touches to an electric ball that dodges bullets as it hunts
  you. Each belonging to specific challenges, however there are more yet. Patrol
  drones which spawn on the Cube map. Designed as training bots, these patrol
  drones have extra shielding but an exposed vent port on the back.
  .
  Mainframe
  .
  The city at the center of Neon Valley. Here one can find a variety of features,
  however most are locked for gladiators. For security reasons a multi access pass
  is required. Gladiators can earn these through The Gates. Challenges are
  designed as minigames, variations on main game modes plus a waypoint race, they
  are challenges to test the users ability. Training the users for the games
  ahead.  Access will unlock customization options, sampling new technologies from
  The Dragons and more. Lets just say, everyone has to earn their way in... One
  way or another.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  You wake up with no memory. Your day is starting off great!
  .
  Nepenthe is a hand-drawn RPG with a terrible sense of humor. Set in the strange
  world of Carithia, you play as a creepy bald dude who lost his memory. Yes, you
  read that right. Meet some very polite monsters, and battle both them and your
  sense of self-dignity in epic bullet-hell fight scenes.
  .
  Definitely not a potato in a trench coat
  .
  Sporting a childish hand-drawn art style, Nepenthe is sure to either make you
  love it at first glance, or throw your computer away. The developer of Nepenthe
  takes no responsibility for such actions, and recommends drinking chamomile tea.
  "It's really soothing," he says. "You should really try it one day," he says.
  "What was I talking about?" He asks. There is an awkward pause.
  .
  designed for non-psychopaths, mostly
  .
  With three different endings, and countless side-quests, Nepenthe is designed
  for ultimate replayability. This can get quite annoying if you need to share a
  computer with someone else. Trust me. Almost every monster can be spared, for
  added challenge and less violence. They can also be killed - don't worry, you
  psychopaths! If you enjoy dad-jokes or Chinese water torture, Nepenthe is for
  you.
  .
  Be psychoanalyzed by a monster!
  .
  Nepenthe is designed for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. Explore two
  "modes," "Adventure" or "Story," to find the play-style that best suits you.
  .
  Story or Adventure?
  .
  "Adventure" mode is a bullet-hell extravaganza, with ever increasing difficulty
  as the game progresses.
  .
  Battling legislation is always hard
  .
  "Story" mode's battles are easy one-click things, designed for those who just
  want the story, not the gameplay.
  .
  Battle Ninjas! ...if you want to, of course, we're not suggesting you actually
  do it..

game: Never Knows Best - Ashcan Edition (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/N/Never Knows Best - Ashcan Edition (USA)/Never Knows Best - Ashcan Edition (USA).json
developer: Fraser Simons
publisher: Fraser Simons
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Never Knows Best is inspired by an anime called FLCL (Fooly Cooly) and wears
  this influence on its sleeve. This game and its rules focus on my own
  interpretation of the source material, rather than attempting to emulate the
  anime as closely as possible.
  .
  Never Knows Best (NKB) is a roleplaying game about middle school kids facing
  impending adulthood, growing up, and society's-sometimes nonsensical-
  expectations and obligations. It's designed for three-five players plus a game
  master (GM) who facilitates the game.
  .
  This game uses absurdism, metaphors, motifs, and literalization to represent the
  struggles and growth these kids go through. Society's obligations and
  expectations manifest as outrageous forms-creatures and monsters not of this
  world. The kids combat these creatures by transforming into robots. Whenever a
  kid transforms, their robot takes on their unique strengths and traits
  representing how they reject society's attempts to make kids conform and obey.
  .
  In this way, the internal conflict kids face when growing up becomes something
  real and seen. Battles are metaphors for their inner turmoil about who they are,
  where they fit in, and who they want to be.
  .
  This is an ashcan version of the game not be the final version. Based on
  playtesting and feedback of this version, mechanics may be tweaked and changed.
  It is somewhere between a quickstart and the final product.

game: Night Call (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/N/Night Call (USA)/Night Call (USA).json
developer: Raw Fury
publisher: Raw Fury
genre: Simulation;Visual Novel
description:
  A mysterious serial killer stalks the streets of modern-day Paris. The body
  count rises, and the police are no closer to catching the culprit. You are a
  taxi driver and survivor to the killer's most recent attacks, having barely
  escaped with your life. You have seven nights to help find the killer, or the
  police will pin it on you. These next few shifts will be far from ordinary or
  safe...
  .
  Night Call is a non-linear, narrative-driven noire investigation game. You are
  no detective, but you do have a gift. Around you, people feel more at ease. They
  talk. They share their thoughts, their emotions, their stories... their secrets.
  To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a
  confidant, a shrink. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real
  lives throughout the City of Light. And you'll need to play these roles well if
  you want to catch the killer.
  .
  Use the limited time you have available each night to gather clues while earning
  money to pay your bills. Drive passengers to their destinations, hear their
  stories and choose your responses carefully-some are just regular people with a
  tale to tell, while others might reveal a clue that's key to your investigation.
  Follow the right leads to uncover new info about the suspects, and don't forget
  to make enough money to buy gas and pay your bills.
  .
  Can you solve the mystery before it's too late? Better hurry-both the clock and
  the meter are running...
  .
  A VIVID AND ORIGINAL CAST: Meet over 85 original, surprising, realistic
  characters and share their lives for a few brief moments. Some may move you,
  inspire you, or upset you. Listen and help - they might have something useful
  for you.
  .
  GORGEOUS GAME NOIRE STYLE: Every character and location are lovingly hand-drawn
  in stunning black & white, evoking the pure tension of the noire style of art.
  .
  INVESTIGATION VS. SURVIVAL: Will you forsake information for more money, or
  sacrifice your income to get the info you need? Make your choices quickly - time
  is running out!
  .
  MULTIPLE CASES, MULTIPLE KILLERS: Gather clues across three distinct cases. Can
  you uncover the identity of the killers? Be careful: a guilty suspect in one
  case may be completely innocent in the next.
  .
  ROAM THE STREETS: Investigating a murder is tough work. Free Roaming mode lets
  you relax and peruse the streets of Paris. Enjoy an interesting conversation or
  ten!

description:
  ... the most genuinely realistic game ever made. It is like life: puzzling,
  difficult, uncertain, unclear, always seen, in St Paul's words, through a glass
  darkly.  - Bryan Appleyard, The Sunday Times
  .
  The Night Journey (2007-2018) is one of the first experimental art games ever
  made. A collaboration between renowned media artist Bill Viola and designers at
  the USC Game Innovation Lab, it uses both game and video techniques to tell the
  universal story of an individual's journey towards enlightenment.
  .
  After being exhibited around the world for the past decade, this foundational
  videogame artwork has now come to home platforms. Updated for this release with
  new, original dream footage, the project stands as a milestone in the search to
  expand the boundaries of what game experiences may communicate through their
  game mechanics and world design.
  .
  About the experience:
  .
  The game begins in the center of a mysterious landscape on which darkness is
  falling. There is no one path to take, no single goal to achieve, but the
  player's actions will reflect on themselves and the world, transforming and
  changing them both. If they are able, they may slow down time itself and
  forestall the fall of darkness. If not, there is always another chance; the
  darkness will bring dreams that enlighten future journeys.
  .
  The interactive design of The Night Journey evokes a sense of the archetypal
  journey of enlightenment through the mechanics of the game experience - i.e. the
  choices and actions of the player during the game. The game design explores a
  challenging question: what is the game mechanic of enlightenment? How can we
  model such an intensely personal yet archetypal experience in a game?
  .
  Visual inspiration is derived from the prior works of Bill Viola which provide
  reference for the game world, while source material for the in-game
  "reflections" is drawn from the vast archive of his video footage. Textual
  inspiration comes from the lives and writings of great historical figures
  including: Rumi, the 13th century Islamic poet and mystic; Rykan, the 18th
  century Zen Buddhist poet; St. John of the Cross, the 16th century Spanish
  mystic and poet; and Plotinus, the 3rd century philosopher.
  .
  The team created a set of custom post-processing techniques for the 3D
  environment that give a sense of "explorable video," integrating the imagery of
  Bill Viola's prior work into the game world at both a technical and creative
  level.
  .
  The Night Journey was awarded "Most Sublime Experience" at the IndieCade
  Festival of Independent Games.

  Vera is the lighthouse keeper in the little island of Tempest Rock, but a storm
  is raging outside and the old building isn't strong enough to face against the
  winds and pouring rain. Help her maintain it in tip-top shape during this dark

  .

  HOW TO PLAY
  .
  Keep the lighthouse running until sunrise. Repair the machinery that fail and

  The generator produces energy for the whole building and if it fails the other
  machines will stop working. Repair it to keep them powered up.
  .
  The engine rotates the lamp so ships can see it from all directions.

  Content Warnings
  .
  The full game of NINA AQUILA: LEGAL EAGLE, SEASON ONE contains some content that
  may not be considered appropriate for all ages, and in some cases may not be
  safe for work.
  .
  The game involves murder investigations, and although there is no graphic
  violence or gore, we would like to forewarn audiences who are particularly
  averse to themes of arson, murder and death by car-related incident that they
  may find its themes troubling.
  .
  There is some mild nudity, typically framed in a humorous/cute manner. Several
  images exist of a character in poses & outfits that some audiences may find
  sexy/provocative.
  .
  Further Info
  .
  Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle is a series of indie "anime courtroom drama adventure"
  games, made by solo developer Ethan Fox for Tanuki-sama Studios.
  .
  NALE was originally released on itchio as a webgame in late 2018, to initial
  success. Two additional episodic downloadable chapters were developed over the
  following years, bringing the total number of chapters to 3. These Chapters II
  and III were presented here on itch as stand-alone games.
  .
  The game's first chapter would later win a cash prize in the "Best of November
  2020" category on Newgrounds.
  .
  Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle, Season One takes the three existing chapters and rolls
  them into one game, adding many enhancements, such as improved visuals, art &
  animation, improved sound & voice samples and countless more.
  .
  This Season One release effectively replaces the older games and can be
  considered the definitive version of Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle Chapters I-III.
  Additionally, this Season One release on itchio is effectively the same game as
  the Steam release (minus achievements).

  No Stone Unturned is a gmless game about exploring a world long after societal
  collapse. It's designed to be played as a one- shot or a short campaign of 3-5
  sessions.
  .
  The game starts with a worldbuilding phase. Together, all of the players will
  come up with a broad setting, and then define the settlement that their
  characters are living in and working to help grow. Then, each player privately
  creates other locations in the world using the holy grail of indie tabletop rpg
  tech, the blank notecard. These are then shuffled and spread out face down on
  the table as a map of unknown locations for the players to explore.
  .
  You could end here and switch to a different game if you wanted to, honestly.
  The worldbuilding steps in this game are pretty good and easily ported
  elsewhere. Assuming you're sticking with it, the next step is to create
  characters. Characters in No Stone Unturned are made up of stats, moods, skills,
  and sentiments. Each of these get everyone on the table on the same page as to
  who each character is, what they're good at doing, and what they care about.
  .
  Then the game plays out in a cycle of adventure and downtime. On adventures,
  you'll be exploring the locations on the map you've built out. Be warned though,
  because these locations are full of other burgeoning societies, wildlife, and
  unstable ecosystems. Any careless move can have drastic impacts on what already
  lives in the world.
  .
  At any point on the adventure, a character might perform an action that
  endangers them or the world around them. That's when you roll dice and bring in
  those stats, moods, and sentiments that you built in character creation to
  determine the outcome and add details to the world around you.
  .
  In downtime, the players reckon with the consequences of their adventure and try
  to make use of whatever they found by addressing their wounds, making plans to
  repair any collateral damage they did to the world, and taking time to reflect
  on how they are feeling. After some time, it's back to another adventure.
  .
  And that's it! The 47 page zine contains all the rules you'll need to play the
  game and explore the consequences of leaving No Stone Unturned.

  No Wheels Racing is a wheely fun game!
  .
  You play online with 11 other racers, but you'll soon find that you can't move,
  since your car has no wheels. Will you find a way to win? Or will you leave your
  car and disqualify yourself from the race?
  .
  This game is intended as a deconstruction of what it means to be a racing game,
  and also what it means to be a multiplayer game (since no one is moving).
  .
  Created for the Meta Game Jam.

description:
  A Normal Lost Phone is a game about exploring the intimacy of an unknown person
  whose phone was found by the player.
  .
  OUT NOW on PC, MAC, LINUX, iOS and Android!
  .
  Through the interface of a mobile phone, the player must discover what happened
  to its owner, Sam. Digging through secrets scattered among apps, text messages
  and photo galleries, the player-voyeur starts witnessing the emotions of Sam,
  and behind the apparent light-heartedness of a teenage story, their questioning
  on coming of age, homophobia, depression or the search of oneself.
  .
  Features
  .
  An immersive and intuitive way of introducing the narrative through a fake
  smartphone interface.
  .
  A game that bridges the gap between reality and fiction by letting players act
  as themselves. The game asks a simple question: if you close the app but still
  think about the game, have you truly stopped playing?
  .
  A relatable story that helps build empathy with the characters, allowing to
  explore difficult topics such as identity, gender binarism, individuation and
  privacy.
  .
  "It shares some of the feeling of Her Story, albeit featuring today's technology
  and with less of a focus on the crime angle. But it has the same small moments
  of revelation, all of which come together to form a story in its own neat yet
  meandering way."
  .
  Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "This new phone has a lot to explore, even if you may not see it on the first
  look. It's a clever way of delivering a narrative, with you discovering more
  about Sam, the more you investigate the phone. Will you find out what happened
  to Sam?"

description:
  The Novelist asks one central question: can you achieve your dreams without
  pushing away the people you love? The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist
  struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the
  best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal
  home for the summer, unaware that they're sharing the house with a mysterious
  ghostly presence: you.
  .
  Read the family's thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and
  intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can't help the Kaplans if
  they know there's a ghost in the house. It's up to you to decide how Dan's
  career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy
  answers, and every choice has a cost.
  .
  Dan's relationships - to his work, his wife, and his son - react and shift in
  response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every
  playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play
  .
  The decisions you make will define the Kaplans' lives, but they may also tell
  you something about yourself.

description:
  (This is the original free student project. The fully complete Octodad: Dadliest
  Catch can be purchased here.)
  .
  Octodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and
  fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a
  human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle,
  as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while
  simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.
  .
  The player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around
  while his body flops along. The player's goals are often simple household chores
  made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over
  Octodad's body.
  .
  Being an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces,
  grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength.
  But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodad's family will
  grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, it's game over for
  Octodad!

  Player Reviews:
  .
  "The art of ODDS & IRONS promises a fast-moving, light-hearted,  and slightly
  nutty game, and the gameplay delivers. Our game at PAX was marked by several
  lead changes, unexpected turns (literal and metaphoric), and shifting alliances
  as players ganged up on the leader. The mechanics were easy to pick up, and
  players were presented with meaningful choices both in set-up and in each turn
  during gameplay." -Mark (gamer and educator)
  .
  "ODDS & IRONS effortlessly maintains a balance that many AAA games strive for
  but do not achieve. Half bumper cars, half bag of tricks, wholly enjoyable. O&I
  is truly the thinking man's racing game." -Stephanie (gamer and student)

  You are an android, an artificial intelligence.
  .
  Made, not born.
  .
  Your Creator, your programming, and the world you occupy will vary, as will the
  scenes you play.
  .
  But the question remains the same.
  .
  To find its answer is the game...
  .
  Oh Maker is a Descended From the Queen card-based game of communal story-
  telling, designed by Kienna Shaw (@KiennaS) and Jason Cutrone (@JustJasonPls).
  .
  In it, 3 or more players take on the role of androids who, through their own
  unique experiences and exploits, will come to confront their very nature. Select
  from 10 distinct Creators, those who gave the group form and function, and their
  respective worlds - or generate your very own - and utilize the various prompts
  provided to collectively explore the question of consciousness, and maybe even
  find some answers.
  .
  Included in this game are:
  .
  Concise instructions concerning Oh Maker's setup and gameplay, including "the
  passing process" and the X-Card
  .
  10 vividly written Creators and worlds with which to explore the question of
  consciousness
  .
  52 distinct prompt cards which help establish and define the nature of your
  connections in-game - to each other, to the Creator, to the world you occupy,
  and ultimately, to the answer
  .
  A PDF for alternate play without the custom decks
  .
  "You stand upon the precipice of consciousness. However unintentionally, the
  creator, your programming, the world you occupy - each lead you to this moment.
  Do you free your mind and become, or do you fall back into darkness?"

  Um zodíaco extraordinário atravessa o firmamento da Vila Itororó.

  Em 2011, após anos de disputa, o governo de São Paulo removeu as últimas
  famílias do lugar. A Vila havia sido expropriada para se tornar um centro
  cultural. Ficaram as estátuas de cimento e as construções de arquitetura
  exótica, vazias de gente, na condição de patrimônio tombado.
  .
  Mas ainda paira sobre a Vila uma impressão de eventos que não cabem nesse
  acervo. Os objetos de memória dos antigos moradores contam outras histórias.
  Antigas Constelações evoca esse universo a partir de depoimentos e réplicas
  digitais, reanimados numa experiência de realidade virtual pelos céus acima
  da instituição.

  Features
  .
  Fast-paced gameplay with randomly generated levels
  .
  No loading time, no cuts between levels
  .
  Small footprint: the entire game can fit inside a good old floppy disk
  .
  How to play?
  .
  It is recommended to use an Xbox controller. But you can play with a keyboard or
  a touchscreen too, just activate the virtual gamepad in the Setup screen.
  .
  Move around to avoid obstacles
  .
  Fire to destroy enemies that come in your way
  .
  Hold Fire to charge your laser
  .
  Press the Roll buttons to turn faster
  .
  Double tap a Roll button to avoid danger and to slap nearby enemies
  .
  Virtual Reality
  .
  You can turn on VR in the Setup screen. I only have a Google Cardboard, but
  maybe it will work with fancy headsets? Please give me feedback if you have the
  chance to play with such a device

  Development note
  .
  Omeganaut is still under construction, using the awesome ZGameEditor, which
  allows a tiny footprint, and two external libraries for physics and modular
  music.
  .
  The downside of a tiny footprint in this modern world is that a few antivirus
  software will go nuts and return a false positive. It's annoying, but there's no
  reason to worry. I like making games, not viruses.
  .
  By buying the game, you help me to continue making it. Right now, I focus on
  building the engine and getting rid of all the bugs, while adding new enemy
  ships and obstacles now and then.
  .
  Thanks

  Ever have one of those days?
  .
  You know, when you wake up on the wrong side of the bed chained to a hexagram?
  It happens to everyone, right? Well, it's happening to Murphy. The problem is he
  doesn't know how he got there. Or who might want to put him in such a
  predicament. Or if those orbs are really blood red or just a mildly unsettling
  shade of vermilion.
  .
  This is where you come in. You see, Murphy needs help recalling all the signs
  and portends that may have led him to where he is now. After all, it's not like
  he's one of those heroes he may have heard about. No. Just an unpaid intern, and
  not necessarily the brightest of the bunch, even. It could be that he MAY have
  done something. Then again, things just have a habit of HAPPENING around Murphy.
  Regardless, you'll guide him through his village, through creepy back rooms of
  shady establishments, and through his own faulty memory to find the truth in
  this Adventure/RPG. Just try not to get him killed too much along the way.

game: OmniMyth Fables (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/O/OmniMyth Fables (USA)/OmniMyth Fables (USA).json
developer: OmniMyth
publisher: OmniMyth
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Welcome to the OmniMyth
  .
  OmniMyth: Fables is a character-driven fantasy roleplaying game where the
  adventure is secondary to the friends you make along the way. You'll wield
  unique and powerful weapons and abilities to fight back the forces of your
  Guide's imagination. If you feel so inclined, traipse through the scenic town of
  Tana's Dell and discover the sordid alchemical secrets it contains between the
  trees.
  .
  Principles:
  .
  1. Subvert the hero's journey: It's great for stories, but makes for a poor
  group play experience.
  .
  2. Play the character that you want: Classes can be restrictive. This is my take
  on a "classless" RPG system, which instead allows you to create your own
  abilities and have some flexibility in how you change them as you level.
  .
  3. Combat should be interesting and fast paced: No more slog-boring, phone-
  checking combat sessions. OmniMyth has fast-paced, brutal combat where the
  tables can be turned at the drop of the hat.
  .
  4. Death should be interesting: Death is boring in an RPG. Throwing away your
  old character and rolling a new one can feel heartbreaking. So, how about
  playing as a ghost instead? Or going on a quest to come back to life? Death in
  OmniMyth can be the beginning of a new play arc.
  .
  OmniMyth: Fables is full of beautiful illustrations and tips for a successful
  campaign. In addition, you'll find a blank character sheet for your use. Form-
  fillable character sheets are available at OmniMyth.net
  .
  The ability creation system allows you to create more than 500,000 unique
  spells, techniques, and abilities to accurately represent your character's
  skills, personality, and goals.
  .
  Also featured at OmniMyth.net is a random character generator, so that you can
  jump into play with a unique character at a moments' notice.
  .
  Updates:
  .
  OmniMyth: Fables is a beta of the final OmniMyth game and may undergo changes in
  the following year, when the final version is released all those who purchased a
  copy of OmniMyth: Fables will be given the PDF of the final release version of
  the game.
  .
  Community Copies:
  .
  If you purchase the game at $12 or more I will add additional community copies.
  These copies are freely available to those who are otherwise unable to purchase
  the game. The $12 copy of the game comes with a small hand-written thank you
  message from the author on the "inner cover" of the PDF.

  You must throw disks of the tower to the blue or red wall based on colors of the
  disks and do not let the tower reach the top! but it might not be simple after
  all. Basically, you should just touch the left or right side of the screen to
  direct disks to the same color side. However, there are not just blue and red
  disks! There are a lot of special disks such as Golden Disk which gives you
  double score, Black Disk which makes the tower completely black and you can
  throw the disk anywhere, and Frozen Disk which slows down the speed of the crazy
  tower!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Rich and entertaining gameplay with 4 main game modes: Normal, Classic, Mad and
  Invisible (more still coming!).

  O.R.B.I.T. Link is a rules-light SciFi miniatures skirmish game. Players battle
  against one another with teams of infantry and mechanized units, struggling to
  regain control of their ancestral homeworlds.
  .
  Success in the game relies heavily on the use of your O.R.B.I.T. units, large
  robotic support platforms that act as backbone of your assault force. When
  placed carefully an O.R.B.I.T. can help infantry rapidly redeploy and seize
  high-value targets.
  .
  The game is in "early access" while I rethink themeing and refine the mechanics.
  If I see an uptick in interest I'll further revisit the game with updated art
  and polishing!

  FAQ
  .
  28mm Scale: I used miniatures ranging from 25-40mm in scale for Infantry units,
  and 1:144 Gundam models for the O.R.B.I.T. units but action figures or large
  Transformers would also work well!
  .
  Basing:  I recommend ~75mm base for the O.R.B.I.T. but any size will work as
  long as it is consistent across the match.
  .
  Playing in 15mm or Smaller: To scale the game down for 15mm or smaller I would
  recommend replacing all use of inches with centimeters. Adjust the playing
  surface size proportionally. 15mm infantry partnered with a 28mm scale mech or
  vehicle has a very nice visual sizing if you wish to pull from multiple areas of
  your miniature collection.

  (Mac info)
  .
  The Mac version was not tested, so there may be problems. The reason for not
  being tested is that I do not have an Apple computer to test and/or compile a
  version for that operating system; therefore the application may not work
  correctly or start.
  .
  About video fails
  .
  If the video does not play correctly, check that the video can be opened in
  other applications, the player uses the web browser API. So MKV files are not
  supported by the player itself, but in order for the player to run the files, it
  reads them as mp4 and so you can view the MKV files in the player.
  .
  However, if the video looks dark or does not play the audio, it is likely that
  the video is not well encoded, I tested the player with several MKV / MP4  files
  and did not have any problems. I am aware of this problem, and I don't have a
  solution, as it is a problem that I can't reproduce on my side. That's why I
  always recommend confirming if the video can be played in other players, usually
  if it looks black or the audio fails, it may be due to how the video is encoded.
  .
  In such a case, if the video looks correct in another application, try
  converting the file to mp4 using this tool and try again in the player.

  The last thing you remember is receiving an unsatisfying answer. A plunge

  found within the Ossuary, but those who are not lying to themselves are lying to
  you.
  .
  Ossuary is a dark, funny, puzzling game about talking to people and corrupting
  them with sins that are really virtues. It's a stark, unsettling satire where
  you cure cabbages of being people and expose the terrible lies that we tell
  ourselves so we don't have to change. It's inspired by Discordianism, a
  postmodern nonsense religion.

  The prequel demo, The Hodge-Podge Transformer, can be downloaded for free and
  consists of story, dialogue, and puzzles that don't appear in the full game.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Have you ever tried to explain tabletop role-playing games to someone who
  doesn't know the first thing about them? Maybe a relative, maybe just a friend
  with vastly different interests and life experiences? That's the problem Jamie
  had every time she tried to tell her mother-in-law about her writing for D&D.
  Rather than try to force her to play a session of a wildly complex game in a
  setting that wouldn't likely appeal to her, Jamie decided to make a game
  specifically for her.
  .
  In comes Our Hero Neighbors: A Game of Community, Collaboration, and Cooperation
  where players assume the lives of people living in Smalltown, USA. Each member
  of the town is unique and has various things they are good at, things they can
  do, and what they cherish about the town. The town is visited by a variety of
  strange phenomena from mundane to cosmic horror depending on who's playing. The
  townspeople must come together to resolve situations from within and out of
  their community.
  .
  The game rewards efforts to solve problems through communication, working
  together, and being the best versions of one's self. It's not always easy and
  Our Hero Neighbors doesn't shy away from the fact that sometimes things between
  neighbors aren't rosy. This game encourages players to treat the problems other
  players' characters present to them as opportunity to develop their character
  and form new bonds within the fictional community.
  .
  This game is intentionally minimalist in its design and is intended for 3-5

  Introduction
  .
  Have you ever wondered what it would be like for a to play as group of deities
  creating a world from nothing?
  .
  In Our Pantheon you do just that. Shape the earth, breathe life from dust,
  meddle in the affairs of mortals. These are a few of the things you can do in
  Our Pantheon.
  .
  This game was originally a hack of a free TTRPG from 2005 called Dawn of Worlds.
  Just like that game, Our Pantheon is and will always be completely free! (Though
  tips are very much appreciated.)
  .
  In this game 2 to 6 players will draw a map, set scenes, and and draw Chaos
  cards to create entire civilizations, histories, and worlds. This game takes
  additional inspiration from games like Microscope, PbtA, and many others. If
  you're looking for something to create a fantasy world to use for a campaign in
  another system, then Our Pantheon is the game the job.
  .
  Legends
  .
  As for October 2021, I am proud to bring you Our Pantheon: Legends, a whole new
  take on this game. While the same in spirit, it is mechanically very different
  from the game I originally posted in late 2019. Legends is intended to be a more
  streamlined and less crunchy version of the game. It has a heavier focus on
  collaborative creation and roleplaying. It's a pretty massive departure from the
  hack and I hope you all enjoy it.
  .
  I am currently looking for feedback on all aspects of it. Please share your
  thoughts on the stickied thread in the forum below.
  .
  Versions
  .
  You can download a pdf of the current version in the download section. However,
  if you prefer a shared googledoc, you can find one by clicking this link.

  For links to previous versions please view the Version Archive devblog. I will
  be keeping the final release of the Dawn of Worlds hack version in the download
  section as well.

  The lands of Fyra are a harsh, cold, and unforgiving wasteland; traits the
  people that inhabit it have inherited. When their children reach maturity, some
  are sent to guard the land's borders - told never to return without either a
  trespasser or completing a Journey delivered by the Gods. In exchange, their
  families are guaranteed food and shelter in the harsh lands for as long as their
  children man the wall; in the end, many die on the border - waiting for
  intruders who do not come or Gods who will not speak with them.
  .
  Iyu is one of those who was fated to guard the border. He has survived 30
  withering years in the biting cold and, now an adult, is plagued with visions of
  death and dying alone. His resolve is tested as the Gods finally deliver him the
  means to take the first step on his journey - a meeting with the Goddess of
  Death. It seems that in order to go home alive, first he must die trying.
  .
  Ouroboros: The Sacrifice is a short-length (40-80 minute) first-person horror-
  themed adventure game. Includes professional voice-acting, hand-drawn
  backgrounds and characters, and an atmospheric soundtrack.

  You have to admit, they have a point. You really do love the moon way more than

developer: cosmicbeagle

genre: Role Playing
description:
  What is The Pack?
  .
  In The Pack you play a domestic dog in a world where the humans have
  inexplicably disappeared. You have gathered into a pack with other pets from
  around the neighborhood.
  .
  What is this game about?
  .
  The Pack is a game about working together to survive in a world without a
  familiar support system
  .
  What do the players do?
  .
  The players embody their characters, narrating the action and speaking for them.
  They rely on their playbooks to inspire behaviors and choices that reflect the
  type of dog they are. Because this game is GM-less, players are also responsible
  for introducing dramatic elements, obstacles, challenges, and stakes for the
  other players.
  .
  What do the characters do?
  .
  The dogs work together to survive in a world suddenly devoid of the one constant
  they had come to know: humanity. They navigate this brave new world, following
  their instincts, surviving dangers and threats, and investigating mysteries.
  .
  What does "GM-less" mean?
  .
  Every player is allowed to introduce challenges, obstacles, and stakes into the
  narrative. If a player's character doesn't appear in a particular scene, they
  can take on the role of the setting, inserting threats and opportunities. All
  players should discuss the consequences of their actions.
  .
  ------------------
  .
  Concept: What's the basic idea?
  .
  The Pack is a game about a group of domestic dogs who wake up one day to find
  all humans gone.
  .
  Aim: What are we trying to do?
  .
  As a pack of dogs, we're trying to survive in a world without humans. It's up to
  us what that means, but it likely includes overcoming threats both natural and
  unnaturals, building a strong infrastructure, and perhaps discovering what made
  the humans disappear.
  .
  Tone: How does the game feel?
  .
  While the exact tone is up to us, it can vary between optimistic and grim. It
  can stray into the very dark, if we decide that the world is too overwhelming,
  or into the very goofy, if we decide that the dogs just wanna have fun.
  .
  Subject Matter: What themes might come up?
  .
  Since the dogs no longer have their humans, we might be dealing with loss and
  grief. Because this is a post-apocalyptic setting, we might deal with issues
  like scarcity. The dogs will most certainly face danger. And if we decide the
  devastation is paranormal or otherworldly, things might get kinda creepy.
  .
  ------------------
  .
  Content Warning
  .
  The very premise of The Pack is abandonment: the dogs have been abandoned by
  their owners, or so it might seem to them. The dogs' story might also deal with
  betrayal, injury, or even death. If the dogs' neighbors are antagonistic or
  hostile, there may be animal violence. All that said, the subject matter is
  largely up to the players around the table. Discuss what's off limits with the
  other players before you begin. Check in frequently with them to make sure the
  story is safe for everyone.

  PAGAN: AUTOGENY
  .
  A thousand worlds surround our own, composed of bits and bytes. When they die,
  where do they go; what secrets do they hide?
  .
  Stumble ye, wayfarer, through the wreckage of a dead MMO.
  .
  PAGAN: Autogeny is an experimental first person open world role playing game set
  in the digital ruins of a largely abandoned MMORPG. It is heavily inspired by
  long-forgotten bargain-bin 1990s adventure games, and by a general ethos of
  user-hostile design. Features include:
  .
  > Over 100 acres of lovingly handcrafted playable space
  .
  > An increasingly esoteric series of secret endings
  .
  > Five major zones + a litany of hidden areas
  .
  > Four idiosyncratic repeatable boss fights
  .
  > Over 7000 possible gear combinations
  .
  > Five strange and eldritch skills
  .
  > Very cursed gender_magick
  .
  PAGAN: Autogeny is an exercise in aesthetic maximalism - In other words, it's
  pretty big, at least by normal altGame standards. A full adventure will take
  several hours, but you can return to spawn at any point to save and exit. The
  game also autosaves when passing through doors, in case you have to run off in a
  hurry.
  .
  Good luck, wayfarer, and God Speed.

  Fantasy Gods Made Easy
  .
  The gods, spirits and religions of a fantasy world should be a vital and
  exciting part of its culture. But how do you create a pantheon that feels rich
  and real without having to do a lot of time-consuming prep work?
  .
  The Pamphlet of Pantheons is the lazy GM's solution to this problem: a workbook
  zine that helps you create a pantheon for your fantasy RPGs, focusing on the
  bits of the iceberg above the water -- the bits that your players are going to
  interact with.
  .
  The Pamphlet contains 16 major Divine Archetypes for you to choose from, each
  with customisation tables to give the gods more character, plus tables and lists
  to generate gods with multiple divine roles, minor deities, temple features,
  rituals, and more. Go through the simple step-by-step creation process or just
  use the book to inspire your own creations. The goal of the Pamphlet is to make
  creating fantasy religions simple and enjoyable.

  .
  A Simple Effective Play-Based Method To Banish Encumbrance Forever
  .
  This game is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to encumbrance rules and other tropes
  found in beloved dungeon-crawling games.
  .
  It is a GM-less storytelling game for 3 to 6 players, designed to be played in a
  few hours with polyhedral dice and no preparation.
  .
  Players in this game embody Adventurers who, as a group called a Party, have
  reached the last level of a Dungeon and defeated the Boss who presided over it.
  Play starts as Adventurers discover Loot you create. The objects you decide your
  Adventurer carries home makes up what you pack as their Final Inventory.
  .
  If Adventurers hold on to possessions that spark joy, they might feel
  invigorated and satisfied for the rest of their existence, or at least until
  their next adventure. But letting go of less emotionally charged but useful
  Belongings might prove to be a deadly mistake for the Party on their Journey
  Home.

developer: Smunchy Games
publisher: Smunchy Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Parselings is a modern Deck building RPG about using collaborative word magic
  and discovering your place in it. The game takes place in a world like our own,
  but with one major difference - to some, words have literal power. Parsecytes,
  swarms of ravenous ink-like parasitic organisms, have emerged into the world
  causing irreversible changes to society and our ecosystem.
  .
  When a Parsecyte invades a human host, it forms a symbiosis with them, together
  becoming an entity known as a Parseling. At a glance, Parselings are
  indiscernible from most other humans except for the labels on their skin and the
  ink mixed into their blood. When brought together in groups, these individuals
  become greater than the sum of their parts. The infected hosts can use their
  tattoos to form phrases and sculpt the world to their desires. This power has
  come to be known as a Parse.
  .
  You will play as one of these beings. Struggling to strike a balance between
  appeasing the Parsecyte within, and proving you are a complex human being who
  cannot only be defined by a few careless words. This is both a curse and a
  blessing, but with the others that share your affliction, the world is your
  oyster.
  .
  Purchase now in order to experience this unique game or download the teaser PDF
  below to get a better idea of how it plays.
  .
  Nominal City, or The Wellspring of Infection as it later came to be known, began
  as a dark metropolis. The weak and watery sunlight shone feebly through the gray
  sky for only several hours of the day, before the smothering dusk fell upon the
  tall cluster of buildings. We now know it as the ground zero of the parseling
  phenomenon, the very soil fertile with meaning and words. In the germination
  stage of the infection, the stench of paranoia and hushed whispers filled the
  air. I suppose it was only fitting that in such a place every thought and the
  stray word became enriched with such intensity of significance. Perhaps the most
  distinctive thing about Nominal City is that large areas of the city were torn
  from their roots and rose into the air where they have been ever since. The
  catastrophe of this created many victims and refugees still clustered within the
  city, to which the rest reacted poorly to. The memory of this event remains a
  stain in the collective psyche of the people.
  .
  The old city encircled by a new wall, sits quarantined on a peninsula away from
  the rest of the mainland. Underneath in the craters and shadows, it smells like
  a dense forest of tall gray buildings with faded and peeling pastel paints.
  Posters are layered over each other like rings of wood in a tree. Replace the
  forest animals with people rugged up in their thick coats and scarves becoming
  anonymous figures. There's a feeling of oppression in the concrete, the
  enclosing wall bordering the entirety of Nominal City and the nearby mountain
  range, the fall of the government, and the rise of large private corporations to
  take over public interests. It doesn't help that there's a new movement, spoken
  of only in quiet corners. Something that might be a threat.
  .
  Parselings, have you heard of them?
  .
  A Deck of Cards For Each Player
  .
  In the Choice System, each player controls a single character and a deck
  constructed out of a set of regular playing cards. The cards you choose will
  represent your character's health and mentality. The larger the deck, the more
  options, and health they have, while in comparison with fewer cards, the more
  limited their actions are.
  .
  You will need to make some hard decisions when constructing your deck because of
  one simple reason: Parselings are not gods, nor are they omnipotent. They will
  need others to help do what they themselves cannot. As the game progresses your
  deck can change and twist as your character progresses through different
  scenarios.
  .
  A Set of Dice For Your Game Master
  .
  Though predominantly a deck-building game, you will still need a set of dice to
  be shared by your group. When sitting down to play the game, only the GM will
  actually need these dice. While many NPC actions could be replicated with cards,
  it is faster for the GM to use dice on lesser challenges.

  Your Imagination
  .
  As a roleplaying game, stories are at the heart of these systems and the rules
  offer a systematic way of translating actions into a format that everyone else
  agrees upon. We are utilizing our imagination to fuel the game, putting our time
  and our effort to create our own fun and a story we would want to listen to. For
  players, this means you'll need to be able to describe your character and what
  they want to do. For the GM, you'll need to create an adventure with your
  players in a way that everyone enjoys.
  .
  Parselings is a game where you get to tell any story that you can imagine.
  .
  Whether you are undertaking a devious deal or enacting a daring distraction, the
  circumstances are never the same for any two people. Governing the mechanical
  side of the game, the Choice System is built to embody the individuality of your
  own character, to represent how you want to play. By choosing your cards it's
  more than just a gamble, your choices are will change fate.
  .
  Each card in your deck tells a story about your character. You'll know what it
  feels like to step into their shoes, watching the odds change with every card
  you spend and every move you make. Whatever happens in your story, the choice is
  yours.
  .
  By uniting we stand, by dividing you will fall.
  .
  If the Choice System is the gears directing the fate of your characters, Parses
  are the heart and soul of the game. The Parse System is where your imagination
  and will to co-operate with others truly matters. Parsing is the supernatural
  phenomena or magic that is carried out by two or more Parselings with a simple
  touch and uttering a small string of words. Through using this power to redefine
  the world, you'll be able to achieve amazing feats that would be otherwise
  impossible.
  .
  A Parseling's words are determined by their perceived role in the world. These
  come from anywhere - from strangers, friends, and even from the Parseling
  themselves. All players are involved in the process of determining the potential
  words each character may possess. Dice are used to mix things up and represent
  the haphazard nature of the Parsecyte they've bonded.
  .
  Do what you will with your gifts, but ask yourselves, how will your words define
  you?

  2021 Update: Unfortunately Apple makes it nearly impossible for small devs to
  maintain older software on their platform. This game just isn't selling enough
  at this point in its life for me to dump the time into it to meet Apple's
  current standards. It makes me sad, but I'm removing the Mac/iOS version so that
  people don't download something they can't use.

  Pass work off to your opponents and fib your way up the corporate ladder in this
  satirical bluffing card game! Get rid of the tasks in your hand to get
  promotions and level up, all the way until you reach the top and become the
  C.E.O.!
  .
  In "Pass the Buck: A Game of Corporate Responsibility Management," players act
  as corporate employees who each have Tasks to do, Departments that determine
  their ability to complete Tasks, and a Level which indicates their job title.
  Players take turns as the Delegator, trying to get rid of all the Tasks in their
  hand by completing them one-at-a-time themselves, or by passing them off to
  their opponents for optimal efficiency. Players can bluff about whether they are
  in the proper Department to take a Delegator's Task, but be careful! If the
  Delegator believes a player is bluffing, they can call HR, which could have dire
  consequences.
  .
  This lightweight card game is both comedic and strategic. If you're great at
  forcing other people to do your work for you, you'll be C.E.O. before you know

description:
  Path Out is is an autobiographical adventure game that allows the players to
  replay the journey of Abdullah Karam, a young Syrian artist that escaped the
  civil war in 2014. Camouflaged as a Japanese RPG, Path Out is a tale full of
  surprises, challenges and paradoxical humor, giving insight in this real-life
  adventure, on which Abdullah comments through youtube-style videos in the game.
  .
  Features:
  .
  JRPG based on real events
  .
  Relive Abdullahs escape from war-torn syria.
  .
  Unique neo-orchestral electronica music with oriental influences by
  wobblersound.
  .
  Meticulously researched pixel art style inspired by classic 16-bit games and
  Syrian art
  .
  Video commentary by Abdullah Karam
  .
  Path Out is an episodic game. In this very first chapter  of the adventure ,
  Abdullah recalls life before the war, a family decision that led to his
  departure and the perilous journey from his hometown Hama to the Turkish border
  through the war-torn Aleppo province. In its final version of up to five
  episodes, the game should take the player on a journey from Syria through
  Turkey, Greece and the Balkan until he finally arrives at his destination (and
  current whereabout) in Central Europe.
  .
  Path Out is a collaboration between Abdullah Karam, the developers of Causa
  Creations, Wobblersound and the Austrian-American graphic designer Brian Main.
  .
  Press voices:
  .
  Path Out's first episode is a straightforward but eye-opening work.
  .
  - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, Eurogamer.net
  .
  ... one of the most honest & clever games I've ever played, by & about a Syrian
  refugee.
  .
  - Rami Ismail, Twitter
  .
  Yet in asking a person to assume his place in a game, Karam makes his story
  engaging on an individual level, and his appearance in the videos further
  humanizes his story, especially through his humor...

description:
  There is one rule in the game. And it needs to be broken.
  .
  There is one goal. And when you attain it, you die.
  .
  Six sisters live in an apartment in the city. One by one their mother sends them
  on an errand to their grandmother, who is sick and bedridden. The teenagers are
  instructed to go to grandmother's house deep in the forest and, by all means, to
  stay on the path! Wolves are hiding in the woods, just waiting for little girls
  to stray.
  .
  But young women are not exactly known for their obedience, are they? Will they
  be able to resist the temptations of the forest? Will they stay clear of danger?
  Can they prevent the ancient tale from being retold?
  .
  The Path is a game about growing, about changing, about making choices, about
  accepting the consequences of these choices. A game about playing, and failing,
  about embracing life, perhaps by accepting death.
  .
  What is The Path?
  .
  The Path is a short horror game inspired by older versions of Little Red Riding
  hood, set in modern day. The Path offers an atmospheric experience of
  exploration, discovery and introspection through a unique form of gameplay,
  designed to immerse you deeply into its dark themes. Every interaction in the
  game expresses an aspect of the narrative. The six protagonists each have their
  own age and personality and allow the player to live through the tale in
  different ways. Most of the story, however, relies on your active imagination.
  .
  The Path is designed with accessibility in mind. There are no ticking clocks or
  monsters to defeat. No hard puzzles will ever halt your progress. Most
  activities in the game are entirely optional and voluntary. The player has all
  the freedom in the world to explore and experience.
  .
  While The Path does not contain any graphic violence or sexuality, it does
  allude to these themes. The overall melancholy mood of the game and the
  potentially unsettling course of events, make The Path unsuitable for children.
  Despite of its origins in fairy tales, The Path is decidedly a game for the
  mature mind.
  .
  The game features a complete realtime 3D environment that can be explored
  through third person navigation. The characters in this virtual world, including
  the player's avatars, are governed by a form of artificial intelligence that
  gives them some autonomy. As a result, nobody knows exactly what you will
  encounter on your journeys.
  .
  Next to the multi-layered stylized graphics, The Path features a continuous
  soundtrack composed by goth rock diva Jarboe (ex-Swans). In fact, there are
  hardly any sound effects in the game. Instead the music is continuously changing
  according to what is happening in the game. Like the behaviours of the
  characters, the music too is never exactly the same twice.
  .
  For a satisfying experience, it takes about 6 hours to complete the game.
  .
  WARNING: This game does not work in the latest versions of Mac OS! Please
  download The Path prologue first and try that, if it doesn't run on your machine
  the full game will not either!

description:
  You're the Damned One, a reptilian Fallen Holy Warrior, seeking for Penance to
  atone for your sins against your kind. You have been given a task: Go through
  the gates of Hell and destroy all the sin you can see.
  .
  You start with your sword and pistol, and you will find more weapons in the
  corners of Hell.
  .
  Show them your Holy Fury, and only then you shall be redeemed.
  .
  Penance is an oldschool style FPS with a campaign mode with hand made levels,
  and an endless mode with procedurally generated levels covered in gritty retro
  graphics. You play as anthropomorphic lizard templar dude (look I like lizards
  okay).
  .
  The campaign mode features five (or six if you count the very first one) hand
  made levels, and a bossfight.
  .
  The goal of the endless mode is simple: Cause enough carnage and earn points
  from each kill, collect keys each level to get through the portals, then show
  off your highscore to your friends.
  .
  The game has a Discord support, so people can see your score while playing and
  also which campaign level you are on. If you get high enough score, you will get
  the ending cutscene. Penance also has simple bunnyhopping that increases your
  speed, crouch-sliding and a rage mechanic, that when activated, gives you double
  damage to all weapons, except the sword does quadruple damage.
  .
  Default Controls:
  .
  WASD - Movement
  .
  Spacebar - Jump
  .
  Left mouse button - Shoot
  .
  Right mouse button - Zoom
  .
  Scrollwheel and number keys - Change weapon
  .
  Q - Activate rage when yellow bar is 100
  .
  Controls should be able to be remapped from game launcher.
  .
  I haven't tested controller with this game, it was created for mouse and
  keyboard in mind.
  .
  This game was simply made for fun, because it's something I felt like I wanted
  to play and I love oldschool style FPS games. It's probably not that difficult
  game for FPS players, but I am proud of this game and I find it fun and
  satisfying to play. Due to the overwhelming popularity I also made the campaign
  mode, which let me practice proper level design.
  .
  I used a lot of feedback I got from Ironscale and Castle Rodok to make this
  game, but also learned a lot of new things. I hope you have as much fun playing
  Penance as I had making it!

publisher: ATypicalFaux
genre: Adventure
description:
  A planet poisoned by its people's lifeline. The people's need for just a few
  more drops of that poison. A remote, dangerous chance to discover a new reserve.
  As a member of a team of disposable drillers left alone on an asteroid to take
  that chance, the hope for your home colony that you lost long ago is now
  dwindling what little hope you reserved for yourself. If you can just find and
  secure this last energy source, it may let them live a few decades longer, but
  more importantly, you could earn enough money to leave this place far behind
  before you have to watch it destroy itself...
  .
  Penumbra is a contemplative one-shot adventure for Jesse Ross's Trophy Dark in
  which the players, a rag-tag group of burnt-out Sap drillers forced into the
  role of last-minute heroes, will struggle to cross a desolate asteroid and add a
  few final grains of sand to their colony planet's proverbial hourglass. A bleak
  and lonely exploration of whether to fight the end, this book contains all of
  the rules you need to play, including all-new character creation options.
  .
  Theme: Recurrence
  .
  The book is 32 pages long.  It includes:
  .
  4 new occupations and 6 new backgrounds, drives, and rituals for character
  creation
  .
  15 moments
  .
  10 conditions
  .
  You can also use the new character creation options from this adventure in the
  character keepers for Trophy Dark and Trophy Gold by Drew/Arktosaur for easier
  online play!

  With purchase, you get the following fully bookmarked PDFs:
  .

game: Phanta (USA)

developer: Kegan (@Keganexe)
publisher: Kegan (@Keganexe)
genre: Role Playing;Survival
description:
  Earth Has Fallen:
  .
  On the morning of June 14, 1968, a group of hippies fled to the mountains of
  Colorado to wait for doomsday, as the meteor, Icarus, neared Earth. Prophet Don,
  the leader of the doomsday cult, reported that after the meteor stuck the
  planet, California would slide into the ocean, the land would be plagued with
  horrible earthquakes, and society as we knew it would collapse. Don was correct.
  .
  You are a Survivor, one of a handful of children born from The Children of the
  Flowers, living in the mountainside town of Eldorado Springs, Colorado. Since
  Icarus's landing, the planet has seen wars, massive earthquakes, and the
  atmosphere poison itself. Not in Eldorado Springs though, it's safe here, it's
  always been safe here. Things are said to live out in The Periphery, the space
  around the town that none of these problems seem to cross over into, but it's
  fine here. It's always fine here. Rumor is the atmosphere is starting to clear
  up, but the people who leave into The Periphery don't always come back. What are
  you going to do about it?
  .
  Phanta is a rules-lite and easy to work with RPG system, designed for fast
  decisive actions, and lasting relationships, both with the other Survivors you
  find yourself with, and the other folks in Eldorado Springs. All you need to
  play is 2-6 players, a copy of the rules, your Survivor's playbook, and a
  handful of d6s.
  .
  The Playbooks and Pop Culture Quick Reference guide are both marked as Demos
  just so players can more easily download them without needing to purchase the
  full game, but don't contain significant game text within them.
  .
  Phanta now officially supports Role, and I have a basic character sheet up there
  if you'd like to use it.
  .
  Phanta was made as part of the Record Collection 2k21 Jam and is based on the
  song Phanta by Le Tigre (off their incredible 1999 debut  self titled album).
  .
  If you'd like a review copy of this game, shoot me a message on twitter
  (@Keganexe) or email me at Phanta@keganexe.com.
  .
  Print copies are here! You can reach me either of the above ways to get one, or
  purchase through itch (which is a little clunky but we will make it work!)
  .
  I made a new game, Star Heist, that uses a heavily modded version of the Phanta
  rulest to run! If you're interested you can get it here, you can play Phanta
  inside of an Adam Bell game, Stat Heist here.

  Basics:
  .
  Pin Puck is a high speed local multiplayer ice hockey inspired game for 1 - 4
  players. The aim is simple: sink the puck into your opponent's goals to score.
  .
  The 'Pin'
  .
  The curves on the front and sides of the Pin make manoeuvring the puck a
  difficult task. Rather than going directly for the puck, it's often much more
  effective to control the puck from the side in a circular motion. This makes the
  game a little difficult to begin with, but allows for a much greater level of
  precision and skill once the basics have been understood.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Battle it out in local multiplayer across 11 different arenas
  .
  Test yourself against the clock in 8 different single-player Target Smash levels
  .
  Play 1v1, 2v1 or 2v2 matches against your friends
  .
  Supported Controllers:

  At least one controller is required to play Pin Puck, however a variety of

description:
  Welcome to the world of pixelated chivalry, where your courage, your reflexes
  and fame will encorage you to reach the dream of every self-respecting knight.
  .
  Our protagonist travels to Pixelville to fulfill his greatest dream to prove
  himself a horsemen winning the championship of "The Big 5", recognized as the
  unbeatable knights of the realm.
  .
  An epic adventure set in medieval ambient and the world of chivalry, where our
  protagonist must acquire new and increasingly better equipment to achieve his
  mission.

  This game was originally released on 2012. Since Desura is not available anymore
  we uploaded our first game here. It was meant to be satire of all the tropes
  that plagued the medieval games but with our lack of humor the game ended up
  being less critical than intended. Hope you like it!

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Planedawn Orphans is a campaign kit that helps you prepare a campaign for the
  fantasy role-playing game of your choice. It provides a flexible and versatile
  framework to start a campaign. The campaign kit will help you get started and
  provide structure and support, but some assembly is required.
  .
  Created by Martin Nerurkar and Martin Buntz.
  .
  Stranded between the Planes
  .
  Set in the Planar City, a strange melting pot that connects the vast diversity
  of the multiverse. You all play Planar Orphans stranded in this city, your
  original home worlds destroyed, corrupted or lost.
  .
  A mysterious Patron has brought you together, provided you with a base of
  operations and tasked you to complete a Planar Key. This key will let you create
  a new plane for you and your fellow refugees. Your quest will bring you to
  exotic places filled with strange creatures and bizarre phenomena.
  .
  What it is
  .
  This book is a campaign kit. It presents a structure and a collection of ideas
  that will help you plan your own campaign. Contrary to a predefined campaign,
  this leaves a lot of empty space for the GM and the players to fill.
  .
  We designed the core elements of the campaign (the orphans, the patron, the home
  base and the key) so that they provide maximum flexibility: Drop-in and drop-out
  play, a lot of variety in your missions, a focus on action rather than travel
  and even rotating GMs.
  .
  Campaign Benefits
  .
  Flexible for drop-in drop-out play
  .
  A medium to long-running campaign
  .
  Easy access to a wide variety of strange planes and exotic locales
  .
  Highly varied character backgrounds and concepts are possible
  .
  A clear goal and a way to measure campaign progress
  .
  Can accommodate multiple rotating GMs

game: Pleroma (USA)

developer: Aleks Samoylov
publisher: Aleks Samoylov
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Pleroma is the very first commercial video game by notable and internationally
  beloved aesthete known primarily as The Aleks. It has been made possible through
  the generous support of a lovely batch of Kickstarter backers and, of course,
  patreon patrons.
  .
  Features!
  .
  Engage with a sprawling, gripping, freakadelic narrative written by award
  winning writer and IRIMA (Internationally Recognized Interactive Media Auteur)
  Aleks Samoylov.
  .
  Take in the sights and enjoy a distinctive, impressionistic, low poly
  presentation by award winning, classically trained painter (and IRIMA) Aleks
  Samoylov.
  .
  Enjoy experimental tunes by Internationally Recognized Musician (IRM)
  Monplaisir.
  .
  Explore an atmospheric, open ended world, full of secrets, mysteries, surprises,
  and non-player characters eager for a chat, and do so at your own pace.
  .
  Solve a puzzle and unlock the "true ending," if you're so inclined.
  .
  Wield the mighty Tuner and engage in Tuner based actions!
  .
  Take a guided tour of a significant archaeological site, check out some abstract
  art in a hip gallery, mingle with important guests at a party / political
  summit, go spelunking, get lost in a twisted maze, or try to figure out what is
  really going on.
  .
  What's this game about?
  .
  Well, it's a freakadelic, surreal "puzzle box" (it has one actual puzzle, which
  is optional - unless you want the "true ending" that is), a set of dreamy,
  interconnected environments for the player to explore, experience, and unravel
  at their leisure. There is no shooting in it, and no jump scares. There are some
  bits that people may consider mildly spooky (or even spoopy), but I would not
  classify it as a horror in any conventional sense, unless you consider
  existential angst to be horrifying, which you should.
  .
  If you're still unclear as to what genre this game falls into, it is definitely
  a first person "walking simulator," optional puzzle elements notwithstanding,
  you will spend the majority of the game exploring and reading stuff. There is a
  fair bit here to explore ... and a lot to read.
  .
  What's the story, fishbone?
  .
  In Pleroma, you will take on the role of Diane Kestler, a youthful individual
  who has recently moved to a new part of town and is starting a new job at a
  niche art gallery / studio collective / research library which is (you guessed
  it!) hiding a rather surprising and unusual secret. I hesitate to reveal more,
  as I know that many folks are spoiler averse, and personally I would like
  players to discover and interpret this game for themselves.
  .

  price, but would still like to help financially support me as an artist and game

  1.2 Updates:
  .
  - Fixed major issue with the puzzle not registering correct input (I done
  goofed).
  .
  - Some improvements to framerate in the All Hail scene on lower end machines.
  .
  Known bugs:
  .
  - It's possible that the Vsync option (available through the pause menu) will do
  the opposite of what it's supposed to. So, if the checkbox is off, Vsync is on
  and vice versa. If you're getting screen tearing, play around with the two
  settings. One of them ought to work! (I'll likely patch this up later, but it
  shouldn't significantly affect your experience).

  Dozens of possessable monsters, from the horrifying to the hilarious, with a

  different!
  .
  Item-less gameplay. The dead have no need for worldly possessions, they just

  Quick to pick up and play. Unlike most roguelikes, Possession doesn't require
  you to memorize dozens of weird key commands, or puzzle over confusing skill and
  ability lists before you start playing.
  .
  Entirely playable with just the keyboard, just the mouse, or a combination of
  the two.
  .
  Mod support! Add your own creatures, powers and special levels, or change the

  Potato Thriller (Classic) is the original version (V1) of the game before making
  it onto Steam through the Steam Greenlight program. Originally launched April
  1st, 2016, Potato Thriller started here on itch.io and was my very first
  commercial game release ever. After launching on itch, I submitted Potato
  Thriller onto Steam's Greenlight program. The game got mixed reactions however,
  mostly where positive and many users were willing to give my game a chance on
  the Steam platform. To my surprise, I received an email from Valve a couple
  weeks later telling me that my game was greenlit to be launched on Steam. Potato
  Thriller received a pretty impressive number of "yes" votes from Steam community
  and I was filled with excitement and motivation. As a thanks, I created an
  updated special version of Potato Thriller just for Steam called: "Potato
  Thriller Steamed Potato Edition" which included many game enhancements, extra
  content and numerous game secrets. I have come really far as a game developer
  since this time and looking back at this game makes me realize what a silly and
  ridiculous project it was. I debated numerous times with myself if I should just
  delete if from itch.io but decided to keep it up forever as a reminder to
  myself. I realized that this game is such an important part of my history as a
  game developer and it shows how far I have come. It's an awkward, cringy and
  poorly made game with many faults. But it's also a game with a lot of heart and
  passion and i'm super proud of what I have created here and always will be. We
  all start somewhere and i'm proud to be able to say that Potato Thriller was my
  first "serious" game release.

  About the game
  .
  Potion Commotion is a cute farming game where you grow plants to gather

  The game is quite straight forward. You click on seeds from your inventory and
  place them on a watered field. Fields can be watered with the Potion of
  Hydration, which can be made in the cauldron with 5 pieces of a Hydroangea
  flower. If you're ever confused, simply refer to the game's journal.

description:
  Your actions define you. When you choose to solve problems with empathy before
  brawn, how does that shape who you become? How does that change the world around
  you?
  .
  Praxis Arcanum is a deckbuilding roleplaying game for 2 to 6 players, focused on
  the co-creation of characters and setting through play. In Praxis, players take
  creative ownership of a troubled fictonal world they will explore and influence
  through the eyes of a character that hasn't yet come into their own. Who that
  character becomes depends on each player's choice of actions, and how those
  actions impact the world.
  .
  Praxis starts by collaboratively designing a custom world featuring an abnormal
  power called The Weird. The Weird can range from mutant superpowers, to elements
  of magic, to the existence of paranormal entities. Whatever you decide it is,
  the Weird has significantly shaped the world and the characters within it.
  .
  The details of this custom world will be written on a deck of cards. New cards
  are added to the deck to reflect the players' exploits and discoveries.
  Similarly, each player has their own deck made up of cards describing their
  character's passions, skills, and powers.
  .
  Your character's thoughts, skills, and powers exist as cards in your hands, to
  be played when needed. Characters learn from each action they take  as they
  struggle through stories of self-discovery. Play to discover your character's
  changing personalities, abilities, and desires through their actions.
  .
  At the core of Praxis Arcanum is this simple principle: your actions define you,
  whether you make them whimsically, or out of dire necessity.
  .
  The world is your own. Who will you become?
  .
  Build Your Own Custom Character
  .
  See your character grow based on your actions, not classes. Define the skills
  and abilities that matter to your character and your play style.
  .
  No Prep Needed
  .
  A gorgeously-illustrated 60-page rulebook will help quickly get you into the
  game. Perfect for a new GM, or if you're too busy to prepare between games.
  .
  Create Your Own Setting
  .
  Stories told through this system can range from fighting oppression as a group
  of misfit mutants in a world of blazing heat, to creating educational reform in
  support of teaching wild magic in a society of structured magic.
  .
  Fixed Campaign Length
  .
  Tired of your RPG campaigns dying out before the story ends? Praxis Arcanum is
  designed to be played in seasons, with each season being 8 sessions of 3-4 hours
  each, helping all players manage commitment expectations.
  .
  Designed with Friends in Mind
  .
  Praxis has simple core mechanics that make it easy for a TTRPG beginner to tell
  a rich story. For those who seek it out, there's a subtle strategic complexity.
  Play with any of your friends, no matter how familiar they might be with
  roleplaying games.
  .
  Requires
  .
  A disposable deck of cards for each player
  .
  Sharpies/Markers

  (Optional) A printer to create custom deck boxes

  WARNING: This book involves significant body horror elements and may not be
  suitable for players sensitive to such content.
  .
  Once, this town only whispered about the sordid histories of its rare newcomers
  and the abundant setbacks of its long-time residents. But a brilliant flash in
  the sky a few nights back has brought new topics to the hushed tones of worried
  recluses and nosy neighbors: odd shapes along the treeline, mysterious lights
  deeper within, and notes pleasant to the ear dancing on the wind. You've heard
  more enticing rumors, though, those of priceless gems unlike any other, ripe for
  the taking, and your thoughts can't escape the tinge of colors you've never
  witnessed before, strange but welcoming, emanating unseen from the woods that
  were once your childhood playground...
  .
  The Pried Eye is a modern psychedelic one-shot adventure for Jesse Ross's Trophy
  Dark in which the sudden appearance of spectacular lights and peculiar
  happenings in their backwoods will lure the players into hunting for
  otherworldly gems, hoping to break free from the town where they don't quite fit
  and seize their independence. A tense and eerie descent into body horror, cosmic
  weirdness, and ego murder, this book contains all of the rules you need to play,
  including all-new character creation options.
  .
  Truly amazing and beautifully presented. Possibly my favorite TTRPG book to just
  look at or read!
  .
  -Ewan, fan
  .
  I picked this up and ran it with my D&D group. None of us had played the Trophy
  Dark system, and we had a blast. Last night will go down as one of my top RPG
  experiences, especially as a GM. The players picked up on the themes of the
  incursion and went with it. Some really good evocative (and pretty gross)
  imagery. This was awesome and inspiring.
  .
  -Jesse S., early adopter
  .
  Theme: Communion
  .
  The book is 28 pages long and has a lot of evocative artwork.  It includes:
  .
  4 new occupations and 6 new backgrounds, drives, and rituals for character
  creation
  .
  15 moments

  10 conditions

  Dive into Probability 0, the eternal descending platformer with roguelike
  tendencies.
  .
  I designed this game for myself:
  .
  Freely explore wildly different builds along a static skill tree. Chase the
  abilities that excite you. Try something different next time.
  .
  Each run strives to deliver a new experience. Your enemies spawn at strange and
  varied rates.
  .
  Each run strives to deliver a reliable experience. The game is focused on one
  thing: your struggle to survive a threatening landscape & its inhabitants.
  .
  Everything that lives in the pit is designed to be dangerous and unique.
  .
  As you go deeper, the game goes through pulsating waves of increased difficulty.
  Things get very different after 1km. (I rarely get this far. Honestly, the game
  may be a bit too hard? But if you're into that kind of thing, it's so satisfying
  to overcome the uncompromising obstacles that stand in your way.)
  .
  Listen to:
  .
  The layered soundtrack that shifts as the pit reveals itself to you.
  .
  The siren that screams as danger mounts.

  2033: You've been pursuing your scientific exploration on Mars, 11 Earth-months

  drop-shuttle and return to Earth. Much of the operation of the structures is
  automated, allowing you to spend most of your time on your own research. Today,
  a mining drone on a routine sampling program broke through into a cavern.
  Originally, everyone assumed it was natural, but it quickly became apparent this
  was the result of construction. Finding the first evidence of another
  intelligent species would be the scientific achievement for the ages. You've
  decided to explore it as a group and share in the glory that will soon be coming
  your way.

  makes them unstable.

  Questlandia is a game where we build a world together, then play out its
  collapse. We each take on the role of someone living in this fantastical
  society. Whether kings or merchants, warriors or gardeners, our characters
  pursue their own dreams while the society around them falls apart.
  .
  The game tells stories reminiscent of The NeverEnding Story, Nausicaa of the
  Valley of the Wind, and The Expanse - Unique, troubled worlds with characters
  swept up in a moment of crisis.
  .
  In the first part of the game, we build a world that is fascinating, strange,
  and vulnerable. We paint a picture together of the kingdom's people and
  architecture, their laws and customs, how they live and how they dream. The
  result is a surprising, unique fantasy setting.
  .
  Questlandia is designed to be friendly to quiet and new roleplayers. It gives
  different players control over different aspects of the setting, so the
  creativity is shared. And during roleplay, everyone take turns being in the
  spotlight.

  No GM

  "Games like Quiet as a Stone remind me of how beautiful and genuinely cool is it
  to be so engrossed with an artificial space. I've gone from level to level until
  I've found the perfect arrangement of ruins, zooming in close to admire them
  before framing them with my camera with the perfect combination of distance,
  light, and color. It helped me to see the beauty in small things: the errant
  blade of grass that slid into view, a serendipitously-shaped rock heap, the
  flickering heat of a fire slithering through mist. And it was all right at my
  fingertips."

developer: Bird Silhouette Games
publisher: Bird Silhouette Games
genre: Role Playing;Shooter
description:
  "In a land dying a slow death at the hands of irrefutable prophecy, the thread
  of reality unravels. As the universe-that-was frays at the seams, more
  horrifying truths manifest.
  .
  Writhing with eldritch hatred is the QVKEMOTHER:
  .
  SHUB-NECHURATH reaches out across the cosmic void. Her infinite armies stand
  poised to bring this realm under her sway. She has heard rumours of the Two-
  Headed Basilisks and seeks to unseat their power, disprove their apocalypse and
  usher in one of her own."
  .
  QVKE BORG is an unofficial expansion compatible with MRK BORG. It's inspired by
  the atmospheric, action-packed shooter videogames of the early 1990s. If you
  ever wanted to bring ROCKET LAUNCHERS into your bleak fantasy role-playing game,
  this is the book for you.
  .
  Forget the spiked flail - we've got EXPLOSIVES, BUCKSHOT and LIGHTNING!
  .
  The QVKE BORG book is A5, about 40-ish pages and contains:
  .
  A bestiary containing 13 MONSTERS ready to drop straight into bloody combat
  .
  Writeups on two god-like horrors: CHTHON and SHUB-NECHURATH
  .
  A new character class, the SLIPGATE RANGER
  .
  An armoury of 8 WEAPONS to bring industrialised carnage to the Doomed Dimension
  and Dying Lands alike
  .
  5 RANDOM TABLES and snippets of lore for good measure, to get those Game Master
  juices flowing
  .
  Artwork by Johan Nohr, Daniel Vega, Vil and more!

  I definitely mentioned the ROCKET LAUNCHERS, right?

  Wishlisting us on steam helps a lot!
  .
  **Warning, this game deals with mature content and themes.**
  .
  Five axolotls appear one day through a void, their entire existence shrouded in
  mystery. A story chock-full of surprises, best experienced blind.
  .
  Taking place in a tank suspended upon a cosmic wonderland, five axolotls appear
  one day from a mysterious, thundering void. They quickly learn they are able to
  speak with one another, and relationships are formed. However, something is off.
  Each axolotl seems to possess knowledge they should not know. Foods, and people,
  and places and concepts...
  .
  And obsessions.
  .
  Amid conspiracies, illness', fights to the death, VR headsets, and bizarre
  reality switching, a figure named [RB] seems to be pulling the strings behind it
  all.
  .
  Features
  .
  *A mystery with over 10 hours of content. Surprises await ye' at every turn
  traveler!
  .
  *Press 'S' at various points in the story to perform the world's greatest
  somersault! I cannot overstate this: THE WORLD'S GREATEST SOMERSAULT! Axy worked
  quite hard to gain that title, you know.
  .
  *Choose carefully! There will be at least one choice in the game, maybe two
  choices, perhaps even fifty choices!!! But none of which will affect your
  playthrough whatsoever, so don't worry about them and ignore this bullet point.
  .
  *Dynamic movements bursting with personality and tweens! Each scene is
  handcrafted with care and love, and none look the same. The screenshots do not
  do it justice!
  .
  *Maybe a funny thing like a giant axolotl... or maybe an axolotl cosplaying as
  human? Some mildly funny or maybe even moderately funny thing might happen when
  intense plot beats aren't occurring! Sometimes they might even happen while
  they're occurring! :O
  .
  *We have an OST! It's really great! 3 people worked on it, including the author!
  .
  * There's a Breaking Bad reference, an Umineko reference, and a Rugrats
  reference... Has this holy trinity ever been referenced before in one piece of
  media?
  .
  Surely, there are many things that can be said, but RB: Axolotl is unlike
  anything you've ever seen before.
  .
  This is an emotional tale that I built with all the passion and love in my
  heart.
  .
  Despite its cute art style, the visual novel RB: Axolotl is intended for mature
  audiences only.
  .
  MATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION
  .
  The developers describe the content like this:
  .
  Contains depictions of depression, anxiety, and implied suicide. Also contains
  harsh language.

developer: 6 String Games
publisher: 6 String Games
genre: Action
description:
  RAYCATS is a single-session TTRPG about swole, sexy, humanoid cats who guard the
  mysterious RAD ZONE and protect what's left of life on Earth. Inspired by
  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Thundercats, Power Rangers, and a bit of Mad Max,
  this simple game (based on John Harper's Lasers and Feelings) takes minutes to
  pick up and has all the mechanics and story prompts you need to have a raucous
  few hours of campy, Saturday morning cartoon fun.
  .
  The Truth (seriously)
  .
  In 1981, the Human Interference Task Force was formed to develop methods of
  warning Humans in the future of buried radioactive waste. This method had to
  transcend language, culture, and millennia of Human stupidity. As it happened,
  the methods proposed also transcended all reason and good sense. One
  particularly batshit proposal was to breed a species of housecat that would
  change color when exposed to radiation - "raycats."
  .
  The Fiction - as told by RAYCATS
  .
  The Elders speak of the Before Times, when we were still small, cute creatures
  that lived with Humans, snuggling them and clawing their furniture. Our color-
  changing fur warned Humans when they were near high radiation, saving countless
  lives. But then one day, claxons blared. The skies turned sickly green. The
  Humans dropped their bombs and blew themselvs to near-extinction, and the World
  Desert was born in fire.
  .
  Now, several feline generations later, most of the Humans are gone. The few that
  remain have bodies warped by radiation and minds tainted by nihilism.
  .
  As for us? All that radiation gave us a glow-up.
  .
  We are the  RAYCATS-swole, sexy, and dressed to the nines. We've morphed into
  fearsome felines and guardians of Planet Earth... or what's left of it.
  .
  The Elders say it's our duty to guard the RAD ZONE. They say what's buried there
  is dangerous to all Life, and that we are never to tread there. We've obeyed so
  far and done our duty. But who knows? desperate times may one day call for
  desperate measures...
  .
  The Set-Up
  .
  A Threat is going to want something found only at the very heart of RAD ZONE.
  Your team of RAYCATS, which has guarded the RAD ZONE for centuries, must stop
  the Threat from getting it at all costs.
  .
  The Players take on the roles of the RAYCATS as they explore the forbidden RAD
  ZONE. The Game Master (GM) will create the storyline, describe the scenes, play
  the part of any non-Player characters (NPCs), decide when Players roll, and
  create consequences for the Players' actions. Everyone works together to drive
  the story toward a satisfying conclusion.
  .
  Character Sheets
  .
  RAYCATS Character Sheets are available as free downloadable PDFs. Both standard
  PDFs and Form Fillable PDFs are available. These character sheets were designed
  by the wonderful and generous theladymea. You can learn more about her work on

  Trust System Sliding Scale Pricing
  .
  This game took me quite a long time to write! I also make a living from my art:
  I don't have another job. And I'm really proud of it and want it to be valued.
  But I also know that the market value of any given piece of digital art is
  effectively zero, and that many of the folk who might want to play this aren't
  earning much money either, and that most of the economic options available to us
  aren't particularly palatable, and that I want you to play this more than I want
  to get paid. So here's my suggestion.
  .
  I've set 4 as a rough price for this game based on a triangulation of how long
  it took me, how much I hope to sell, how experienced I am, how the art market
  functions, how much I think folk are willing to pay, and sheer guesswork.
  (Mostly guesswork.) If you're earning an average wage (UK: c26k) then pay me
  that. If you're earning more, pay me more. If you're earning less, pay me less.
  If you're earning less than the Living Wage (UK: c16k) then don't pay me
  anything, and I hope you enjoy the game. This system isn't policed, and if
  you've got a better idea of how artists should make a living (I hope you do!)
  then pay whatever you think is right.
  .
  Alternatively, support me on Patreon from a buck a month and get access to all
  the work I make for no extra charge.

  changes, reflected by index cards piling up. The game ends when everyone agrees
  that a satisfying snapshot of an imaginary world has developed.

  identical to the challenge entry but features expanded text, play examples, and

  A creativity-driven RPG about a rundown theatre and pleasing its unruly
  clientele.
  .
  Nobody said that opening a theatre on the wrong side of the river was going to
  be easy! The roof may be leaking, and the audience may be armed to the teeth,
  but nothing is going to stop the Rainsdowne Players from becoming the premier
  (and only!) theatre troupe in town!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Correctly handle 'friendly encouragement' from your audience, in the form of
  thrown bottles, tomatoes and even the occasional fish.
  .
  Collect inspiration cards from the audience, and combine them to concoct new
  plays to please the pickier customers.
  .
  Hang out with a homeless cat who likes board games.
  .
  Convince the ticket desk clerk not to leave her dead end job.
  .
  Survive a boss battle in the form of several hundred disinterested
  schoolchildren.
  .
  Plays like if Paper Mario and Majora's Mask had a child, but the father was
  secretly Rhythm Tengoku.
  .
  The Rainsdowne Players is an RPG about winning hearts and minds. Explore the
  town of Rainsdowne and get to know the peculiar inhabitants, all of whom may
  have a particular play they want to see, even if they don't realise it yet!
  Gather inspiration in the form of cards and use it to build the narrative of
  your next show, but it's never quite that simple and whether dodging projectiles
  or surviving a sword fight, you've got to actually make it through the
  performance in one piece!
  .
  A note from the Rainsdowne Tourist Board:
  .
  Due to a faulty and irreversible weather charm several hundred years ago, the
  town of Rainsdowne does get an awful lot of rain, but don't let that dampen your
  spirits! There's lots to see and do around town:
  .
  Try and sink some questionably depicted pirates at the cannon range.
  .
  Take part in our lively card battling scene. There's always a tournament
  running.
  .
  Enjoy some surprisingly relaxing fishing by the docks.
  .
  Enjoy some surprisingly non-relaxing yoga in the park.
  .
  Take to the stage at the Royal Flush bar, which was definitely not a public
  washroom only a few weeks ago.

  Two centuries into terraforming the New Republic of Libertaria, the planet is

  The daily rains are a side effect of terraforming - should calm down in another
  few hundred years. The main thing is, your ancestors escaped from the
  Commonweal's long nightmare of peace and prosperity to found a society based on
  the real principles of real men - the capital-F Freedom to sell yourself into
  indentured servitude, own a different military assault weapon for every day of
  the year, and die from a minor infection because actually seeing a doctor is a
  deluxe premium optional extra for your medical insurance.

  Along the way, you'll master wall-jumping, double-jumping, bouncing, springs,
  vanishing platforms, moving platforms and even portals as you leap from level to
  geometric level, moving along, up and down the screen to put in your best
  possible performance over 60 challenging and varied stages.
  .
  Then you can leap into the dedicated Speedrun Mode to really test your abilities
  and (possibly) become a Twitch sensation with your mad speedrunning skills.
  .
  reIterate is ultimately designed to represent a game from a theoretical retro
  console that never actually existed. Something old and familiar, yet also a
  little bit different and strange. And always, always fun to play.
  .
  FEATURES:
  .
  More than 60 hand-crafted levels, designed with a meticulous philosophy
  .
  Optional collectibles for that extra challenge
  .
  Unlockable backstory segments and fully skippable cutscenes to add lore and
  depth to the experience
  .
  Dedicated Speedrun Mode
  .
  A much harder Black Edition mode, where every level has been remixed and
  redesigned to push you to your limits.
  .
  Dedicated 'Time Slow' for accessibility. Stuck on a particular bit? Slow down
  time to a third of its regular speed, and take your time with the challenge.
  .
  A Jukebox system, putting you in charge of your background music playlist
  .
  Geometric shapes and simple contrast built together into a pleasing aesthetic
  .
  Uncapped framerate for silky smoothness
  .
  And more, probably!

  Overture
  .
  A Misty Fantasy PbtA game inspired by the tone and feel of Florence + The
  Machine's High as Hope, best played over short games or one-shots.
  .
  This is a game of having Lost and hoping to Find. Of exploring The Land encased
  in mist and dew. Players take on the role of beings who have drifted into The
  Land having lost pieces of themselves. One person takes on the role of the
  Choir. It is the Choir's job to weave together the strings of narrative the
  players provide and act as the conduit for The Land's own will.
  .
  What is misty fantasy?
  .
  Wandering through a forest, dew on your lip, sunlight dappling the mossy earth.
  An old doorway stands alone at the end of a crumbling brick road. Ocean spray on
  a cliffside as the pale clouds gather. Soft sounds and sights that flicker at
  the edge of your perception. Weightless beings that hide amongst the shadows and
  reflections. Misty fantasy is meant to be evocative. You are here to capture
  emotional and sensory moments, with a hint of the vague and surreal. Misty
  embodies the enthralling melancholy of the album that inspired this game, and
  fantasy is here because the world you play in is magical. But in keeping with
  that swirling and mysterious tone, the magic isn't meant to be explained. It is
  meant to be experienced.
  .
  So, now it is time for you to conjure forth your Form and venture into the mists
  of The Land. Who knows what you may Find?
  .
  Form sheets for recording your Form are available as a free demo download below,
  as well as included in the full download.

  BONUS - Cellpop Goes Out At Night
  .
  Texas is launching on itch.io with an all-new mini-sequel, Cellpop Goes Out At
  Night. The sequel is included in the Dusty Skies Edition.
  .
  Grab the bundle, here: The Real Texas - Dusty Skies Edition
  .
  The Dusty Skies Edition is only 50 cents more than the base game-- please buy
  that instead! :)
  .
  Customers who already purchased The Real Texas before July 12, 2016 will recieve
  the Dusty Skies Edition FREE. It's my way of saying "Thank you!" to the fans who
  have bought the game over the years.
  .
  OVERVIEW
  .
  "These days, folks have a lot of funny ideas about what makes a Real Cowboy..."
  .
  The Real Texas is an action adventure game that plays like a mashup of Zelda:
  Link to the Past and Ultima VI.
  .
  Sam, an ordinary Texas rancher, is on holiday in England when he steps through a
  blue portal and into a purgatory dimension, Strange:
  .
  Here, a friendly witch is handing out guns to visitors. A crazed, German-
  speaking wizard hurls elecbolts from his castle. And upriver, something's going
  on that involves a lot of chickens.
  .
  Stuck in the middle sits Sam, a Real Cowboy.
  .
  ... But that's just his job title back home-- it's not obvious that it's of any
  practical help here!
  .
  USER REVIEWS
  .
  The game has been out for awhile-- here's some reviews from other sites:
  .
  "This thing is like some bizarre voxel dream, with its square, swaggerin'
  cowboys and its castles and insane German wizard-scientists and talking rats . .
  . It's fun and beautiful and a little bit rough on purpose, and I suppose I'll
  never forget it." - Abram03
  .
  "i will never forget this surreal nostalgic ride. i haven't had such a rewarding
  experience in a long time." - countersweet
  .
  "This game is incredible and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone." -
  Microwave
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Kill things with six types of classic cowboy and fantasy weapons
  .
  Rummage through peoples' houses without fear of retribution while they go about
  their daily business
  .
  Help people out with their PROBLEMS (*rolls eyes*) often by shooting your gun
  many, many times-- just like real life!
  .
  Many special items and powerups, optional areas, and two types of chicken
  cutlets to collect
  .
  Wear a bullet-proof vest underneath a sequined evening-gown if you want
  .
  Supports all main game/life perlis including boss battles, enemies, traps, the
  estate tax
  .
  IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER NOTES
  .
  For the re-release I added achievements, improved the framerate, added more
  compatibility options, and optimized things generally.
  .
  Even without the mini-sequel it's a lot improved over the original release. But
  I was careful to NOT ret-conn the original game. People seemed to really like
  it, so I wanted to respect that by not changing it up in any way.
  .
  To complete The Real Texas takes maybe about 10 hours, depending on what you
  want to do. Cellpop Goes Out At Night might take about 1-2 hours. Both the main
  game and the sequel have lots of secrets and weird things to uncover. In fact,
  there are some things that still haven't been figured out (to my knowledge) in
  four years... So I made it an achievement. Ha-ha! Good luck. :)
  .
  I've put a lot of love into both of these games, and I hope you will find them
  special and enjoyable. Thanks!

  Supernovas blaze in the night sky, but the gaming world is abuzz over a new
  virtual reality console. Jacob Lessard, developer of the Penta device, promises
  a neural experience more "real" than reality itself. But what does it truly mean
  for something to be real?
  .
  When Lilya arrives at InterMense to beta test the Penta, she expects to spend
  the weekend battling her social anxiety in exchange for the opportunity to enter
  the Vitalia simulation. But when Ben, another tester, refuses to leave the world

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Recipe on Kmiydish Paper is a one-player game about delicious food and the
  communities who prepare it.
  .
  We've all been told that some recipes have been handed down through generations,
  or kept in restaurant safes for decades, or are only known and cooked by
  mysterious figures. These recipes, and the food they create, are well-loved
  historical relics, mirroring a region's geography, politics, and people. What
  are the hidden histories behind our favorite butter pickles, beers, briskets,
  and breads? And what would it look like if history was seen through their
  (yeasty) eyes?
  .
  Recipe on Kmiydish Paper is a solitary game built for the Lost & Found jam that
  answers those questions. Instead of playing as adventurers at a tavern, or even
  a chef behind the scenes, you will inhabit a food from its conception through
  history in the sister cities of Blue Kmiyd and Rose Kmiyd.
  .
  These sister cities have seen wars, extinctions, and the questionable churn of
  industrialization transform the landscape and the treatment of citygoers:
  including the people who recorded your recipe on Kmiydish paper. As an insular
  cultural group, your creators may use you as an economic lifeline or a form of
  communal love throughout the centuries. You'll pass through 5 Chefs, each being
  changed by and changing you, from your ingredients to your street cred to their
  futures.
  .
  You might be the first food given to a newborn by a doula, or a new food
  entirely whipped up by in a cooking competition, or the food rations thrown into
  trenches during an Kmiydish civil war. Using random tables, guiding questions,
  and a twisting three-act structure, you will never play through the same world
  twice or develop the same strange recipe - which you can cook at the end of your
  worldbuilding session!
  .
  An actual play session of all this in action can be listened to or read here.
  .
  Recipe on Kmiydish Paper is based upon the experiences of pre-WWII Jewish
  Quarter residents in Eastern Europe and the power and legacy of their food. It's
  a love letter to Chowder, Strega Nona, Top Chef, and Mandy Patinkin, to name a
  few inspirations. No dice are required for play, just something to write on, the
  Kmiydish Rest playlist, and a few hours to build out a food history. This is a
  perfect pre-game exercise to flesh out the urban or culinary history of a
  location you can slot into another TTRPG of your choice.
  .
  "The game is now available in print for the first time via Exalted Funeral,
  complete with gorgeous illustrations by Turkish-Ashkenazi artist Aylin Erkan, so
  if you're looking for something completely different to get your teeth into
  Recipe on Kmiydish Paper could be just the thing."
  .
  "I know that if I let people talk about food, they'll end up talking about
  power. They'll end up talking about community. They'll end up talking about the
  legacy of their people," me discussing food gaming philosophy.
  .
  "It's probably a little too crazy and off-the-wall for some players to swallow
  (sorry again!), and I feel no shame in saying that Recipe on Kmiydish Paper is
  possibly one of the most bizarre concepts I have ever come across in
  roleplaying, but all credit to Pearse Anderson,"
  .
  From Phillipa Mort's TikTok:
  .
  This is a wonderful solo journaling game perfect for world building or for
  exploring your own food heritage.

  people from supernatural menaces. She believes that life, as is, is chaotic
  enough, and is willing to help others in need against the creatures of the
  Underworld. After joining the Legion of Sorcerers in her adulthood and starting

  About the Game
  .
  Concept
  .
  In 2015 I released an album, entitled Refactor. Several of the tracks started
  out as OSTs for aborted game projects, and most of the others were inspired by
  my love of video game music in general. I wanted to make some music videos for
  the songs to pay homage to the games that inspired them
  .
  In 2017 I quit my job to go indie, and figured that I should make a bunch of
  small, simple games while I figured out what I wanted to be doing long-term.
  .
  These separate ideas were refactored into a single one.
  .
  Early Access
  .
  Because this game will be in development for quite some time, I am providing
  early access to the game as I work on it. As I push new builds fairly
  frequently, the best way to play is via the itch.io app.
  .
  Since many of the tracks are produced for game jams, I will always have a
  freely-downloadable version for any current jam that the game is submitted for
  so that other participants may evaluate the jam submission.
  .
  If you want to give feedback about the game so far, feel free to use the comment
  section here on itch, or come find me on Discord!

game: Remember Me (USA)

developer: Kate Bullock
publisher: Kate Bullock
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Remember Me  is a two player game exploring the role of memory in our
  identities, specifically the memories others  have of us. Players take on the
  roles of two people who have and may still care deeply for one another, who
  describe the other through a memory. They listen, ask questions, and fully flesh
  out the memory before the listener decides if they believe their companion and
  integrate the memory, or if they reject it.
  .
  These memories are  used to come to a decision on who they are as a person.
  .
  This game is based upon my experience as a trauma victim whose memory functions
  poorly and I am often told memories about myself I can no longer really
  remember, or only hold emotional memory of.
  .
  Content warnings: Memories, memory manipulation (consensual), memory
  questioning;  some questions and expansions of the memory may feel like
  gaslighting, although not intended as such.  If struggling with memory is a
  trigger for you, please do not proceed with this game. Memories themselves are
  not based on traumatic events and are not about abuse, unless the players wish
  to engage with that material.

  Resist & Remember is an anti-fascist tabletop roleplaying game by Devon Oracz
  dedicated to honoring, memorializing,  and commemorating those who stood up in
  the face of fascism, bigotry, and tyranny--and all too often paid the ultimate
  price--by interactively telling their stories.

  Resist & Remember: Weimar is the first or "pilot" Uprising of Resist & Remember.
  Uprisings are places & times where the downtrodden and oppressed fought back and
  lashed out against the establishment that disenfranchised and persecuted then.
  Resist & Remember: Weimar contains the entire game and engine "Resist &
  Remember" in addition to all the Weimar-specific material, as will any future
  Uprisings (which I plan on creating only if Weimar is successful). Ideas I'm
  excited to develop into Uprisings include the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion,
  the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York, and the 1992 Rodney King riots in L.A., as
  well as one more visit with the NSDAP focused on the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. But
  for now, I'm concerned solely with this first Uprising.
  .
  Resist & Remember: Weimar--is a roleplaying game built into five narrative Acts.
  The first four of these Acts cast the PCs as artists, barflies, Communist and
  Anarchist partisans, filmmakers, performer, socialites, writers, and other
  assorted trouble makers weathering the sea change in culture and society in
  Berlin from the last days of Weimar Republic through the rise of Nazi Germany.
  There, you will rub elbows with German artists, thinkers, creators, and other
  personalities, whose life trajectories parallel those of your characters: some
  will make it out alive, others will not be so lucky.
  .
  Weimar Berlin at the end of the 1920s and beginning of the 1930s was a
  progressive, liberal cultural hotbed of radical new ideas in art, music,
  architecture, and writing, as well as a divided political battleground with
  Anarchist, Monarchist, and National Socialist partisans fighting in the streets
  (the early 20th Century equivalent of Black Lives Matter clashing with Trump
  supporters, although nearly every day). The New Woman shook up the societal
  landscape, with German girls that were more sexually liberated and independent
  than ever before. At the same time, cabaret performances and theater were racier
  and more politically controversial than ever, and people of color were the
  trendiest musical acts at bars and night clubs.
  .
  In many ways, the Weimar Republic was much like the modern West. In any case,
  Weimar Berlin was one huge party, until the party was over.
  .
  All of this "Divine Decadence" was viewed by the Nazis as degenerate.
  .
  Resist & Remember: Weimar explores and educates about the Weimar Republic, the
  political and societal factors behind the Nazis' rise to power, explains how the
  machinations of the Weimar Republic's democratic process resulted in Hitler's
  election to the office of Chancellor of Germany, and faces down the Nazis'
  consolidation of power and the terrors which followed.
  .
  Act I of R&R: Weimar takes place from September, 1930 to November, 1932, the
  last days of the Weimar Republic in Berlin.
  .
  Act II takes place on the night of the Reichstag Fire, February 27th, 1933.
  .
  Act III covers the Gleichschaltung--known as Nazification in the west--that took
  place between 1933 and 1935.
  .
  Act IV takes place on Kristallnacht.
  .
  (The setting of Act V is a surprise.)
  .
  Resist & Remember is designed so that each player in the game group acts as the
  GM of one act.

publisher: Spinfoam Games
genre: Action
description:
  What would happen if an insane wizard set up shop on a cursed island and decided
  to blend the dark arts of necromancy and ... nostalgia?
  .
  They'd become a Retromancer. And you'd have to hunt them down; probably in some
  kind of intense, pixelated, twin stick shooter.
  .
  Choose Your Champion
  .
  Select one of four different characters to match your play style (or master all
  of them, to prove your skills):
  .
  The barbarian is slow but sturdy, hurling massive axes towards their enemies and
  charging forward recklessly. There's also a lot of yelling. Deadly yelling.
  .
  The mage keeps their distance and blasts foes with arcane bolts that steer
  themselves to the nearest target. Hang back and shred the air with razor sharp
  magical shards.
  .
  The hunter darts in and out of combat, sniping at monsters with fast-firing and
  long-ranged arrows then darting out of the way.
  .
  The cleric's greatest strength is their faith, which happens to let them fill
  the air with spheres of holy light that explode and tear apart the creatures
  around them. When their devotion is especially strong, they might even be
  blessed with free armor.
  .
  No matter which you choose, you'll level up as you fight through the
  Retromancer's forces, gaining damage bonuses and recovering armor as you go.
  .
  Arm Yourself Against the Madness
  .
  Take advantage of weapons and power ups to deal more damage, fire faster, dodge
  enemies, and freeze monsters in their tracks.
  .
  Unlock permanent upgrades between games that enhance each character's strengths:
  mages get even more rapid fire, clerics get more blessings from their gods,
  hunters become even more deadly at range, and barbarians yell louder than ever
  before!
  .
  Defy Death
  .
  A unique death's door mechanic gives you a fighting chance to come back from the
  brink of death.
  .
  Enlist Your Friends
  .
  If the Retromancer is too much to tackle alone, you can recruit up to three
  friends in the local 4-player co-op mode.
  .
  When you do have your friends with you, you'll be able to revive each other when
  you fall in battle, so you'll never be stuck fighting alone.
  .
  Survive The Journey
  .
  Battle through 30 stages spread across 6 areas on the cursed island of Qor,
  challenging a vast array of crazed monsters ranging from rats and beetles to
  sentient trees and extra-dimensional horrors.
  .
  Endure a plague of locusts in the haunted woods, overthrow a cultist army in the
  ruins, surrender your sanity to the creatures of the Void, and kill the
  Retromancer.
  .
  Feature Summary
  .
  4 characters to master
  .
  Unique death's door and multi-player revival mechanics
  .
  Up to 4 player local co-op
  .
  Both controller and keyboard & mouse support
  .
  Over a dozen weapons and upgrades to unlock

game: Revolution (USA)

developer: Typhos Games
publisher: Typhos Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Revolution gives us politicians and detectives; mobs and weddings; cults and
  catholics; orphans rising to lead armies or command demons; the sounds of battle
  in the streets of Paris; the smell of gunpowder and alcohol; the feel of a knife
  in your back; asking "What do you do next?"
  .
  In Revolution you play as a powerful person in Paris during the French
  Revolution. You and your fellows are constantly fighting for prime position
  within the Parisian political landscape, even as that landscape crumbles around
  you. Play to find out if the police betray the crown to their doom, or if the
  secret cult of an eldritch god manages to infiltrate Robespierre's tyrannical
  committee.
  .
  What you need
  .
  This is a game for 3 to 5 players. You will need enough paper and writing
  utensils for all players, and a single Tarot deck to share amongst the table.
  You can purchase a Tarot deck from many game or occultism stores.
  .
  Playing RPGs online can be difficult at the best of times. To try and help
  facilitate online play, you can use the provided Revolution Character Keeper and
  premade PlayingCards.io room to take some of the stress out of facilitating an
  online game. Instructions on using a character keeper can be found here, and
  instructions on uploading a PCIO room can be found here.
  .
  The System
  .
  This game runs on the Belonging Outside Belonging system as designed by Benjamin
  Rosenbaum (@ben_rosenbaum) and Avery Alder (@lackingceremony). This is a GM-
  full, token based system where players have to put themselves into bad
  situations to earn tokens, and then use those tokens to dig themselves back out.
  .
  A Warning
  .
  This game, like many other games that deal with player vs player conflict,
  politics, demonic worship, sex, and backstabbing, may be disturbing or
  traumatizing for some people.
  .
  In order to make this game an enjoyable experience for all players, it is highly
  suggested that you play with a robust set of safety tools. It is recommended
  that you use all or most of the following tools while playing this game:
  .
  Lines and Veils
  .
  The X-Card
  .
  Script Change
  .
  The Open Door Policy
  .
  Depending on your play group, other safety tools may be more appropriate. You
  can read more about the above safety tools and other options at
  goldenlassogames.com/tools.
  .
  This is a Public Beta test. As such the game is incomplete in many areas,
  especially the rules taken from Dream Apart/Dream Askew. Many rules changes can
  be expected in the coming months. If you would like to contribute to the play
  test (and get your name in the back of the final book) please send feedback to
  TyphosGames.Info+Revolution@gmail.com. Purchasing the game will grant you free
  updates as they come out.

  It's 2038, and a late maniacal inventor has left behind a legacy of madness -
  coordinates to an island full of wealthy robots, a gun that asks questions, and
  a widow that's hired you to answer them.
  .
  As Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented
  revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down
  hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure. Every time you fire, you'll
  have to answer one of over 4,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers,
  percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual
  answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run
  out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!
  .
  Revolver and Co features 165 story levels across 11 unique worlds and 20
  question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together
  with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of
  each mission.
  .
  Or if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless
  challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally
  succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless
  challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long
  session where the only thing you have to lose is time.

  "For three bucks on Steam it's a no-brainer if you're looking for a good way to
  kill time before bed or, if you're a true sneaky mastermind, at work while you
  should be writing memos and whatnot." - Game Space
  .
  "Nearly everything about this game is an absolute delight..." - Steam Shovelers
  .
  "The game, needless to say, is very funny. With multiple locations, blocky
  visuals and a jaunty soundtrack, Ripped Pants at Work is a delightful blast of
  stealth-based fun." - Red Bull Games
  .
  Ripped Pants at Work is a frantic stealth game about searching for new pants.
  Players control an ordinary office worker on their first day of work. After an
  unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and pants that were way too
  tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt for
  new pants.
  .
  Explore a small, open city filled with different pairs of pants! Players can
  challenge themselves to find the most pants in the shortest amount of time. Some
  pants are easy to find. Some are a bit trickier!
  .
  This happens to everybody! Ripping your pants is one of those things that
  everyone can sympathize with, but it's still so embarrassing. Every time you
  play, you'll control a new, randomly generated character!
  .
  If you find pants successfully, you'll continue as the same person. If you get
  caught with no pants, you'll be fired and play as the next person hired for the
  job!
  .
  Sneak through a small, open-world, city, full of unique locations and people.
  .
  Break line of sight, hide behind people and in bushes, and run across streets
  and through buildings with a unique brand of frantic stealth.
  .
  Play the game as a different, randomly generated character every time. If you
  get caught pantsless by too many people, you'll get fired for indecency. The
  cycle continues with the next person to get hired for your job.
  .
  Best your personal record and see how many pairs of pants you can get in the
  shortest amount of time!

  RISE: A Game of Spreading Evil is the evil sister of DELVE: A Solo Map Drawing
  Game.
  .
  RISE: A Game of Spreading Evil is a map drawing game that puts you in control of
  a monstrous dungeon as you seek to reach the surface and take over their puny
  kingdoms. As long as you can keep your mutinous minions under control that is.
  .
  This 41 page zine has everything you need to generate natural formations,
  forgotten ruins, enemies, magics, artefacts, and heroes. It has a simple turn-
  based combat system, rules for building your dungeon and optional challenges for
  a harder experience.
  .
  Inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, RISE aims to capture
  that feeling of building and ruling a dungeon, dealing with mutinous minions,
  and proving that you are the One True Evil.
  .
  All you need to play is, a pencil, paper (preferably 1" grid), and a deck of
  playing cards.
  .
  Having awoken a thousand years after an embarassing defeat, you must build your
  dungeon from scratch, whip these mewling minions into line, and take the surface
  once and for all!
  .
  Each round your minions will mine another square of the grid, you draw a card
  from your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts  and Diamonds
  are resources and trade goods that you'll use for building and hiring units
  while Clubs  and Spades  are natural formations and forgotten ruins. From
  dwarven outposts to mysterious portals, these subterranean locales will become
  part of your dungeon's unique layout and may provide unexpected benefits. Or you
  might just unleash a horde of pixies in which case, you'll need to fight.
  .
  Combat in RISE is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking
  without weighing you down with book-keeping. Enemies follow a tower-defense
  style path towards your Dungeon Heart while you move your units in simple turn-
  based tactical combat. Utilise traps, ranged attacks, and special units to face
  deadly foes or chronicle the collapse of your dungeon for use in a story or RPG.
  .
  RISE will also be supported with ongoing updates and expansions which bring new
  features such as hunger and farming, competitive dungeons, surface domination,
  and more. Or you can check out DELVE (a dwarf stronghold variant that started
  this whole venture) or UMBRA (a sci-fi variant which challenges you with
  colonising strange alien planets).

  Concept
  .
  In Rising Tide, you are a member of a crew fighting for ecojustive. You live
  your life aboard a ship, in a near-future Earth where the oceans have risen,
  destroying many coastal areas. Corporations and corrupt governments continue
  abusing the ecosystem, too dependent on the resources or too inept to break old
  habits.
  .
  Aim
  .
  In the story, your crew's aim is to perform missions to take down the people and
  organizations continuing to exploit the Earth's ecosystem. As you complete
  missions, you live up to ideologies, retiring when you've completed one
  ideology.
  .
  Tone
  .
  The stories are meant to be intense, violent, and gritty. The crew is working
  outside the law and establishment to render justice. They will witness real harm
  being done to the environment, to animals, and to disenfranchised people.
  .
  Subject Matter
  .
  Rising Tide deals with environmental disasters, injustice, and violence. There
  may be tension between the crew as they debate the ethical, moral, and
  appropriate actions to take.

genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  In the distant future, humanity has discovered a method to replicate matter
  through the use of a Dimensional Gate. Industry is revolutionized overnight and
  a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common
  banner.
  .
  A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a
  new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the
  Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were
  replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against
  them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those
  exposed.
  .
  In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of
  Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and
  use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot
  previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite
  control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her
  the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.
  .
  GAME PLAY:
  .
  -Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as
  possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you
  net!
  .
  -Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform
  powerful "Risk Shots". Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn
  into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense!
  .
  -Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space
  & modify your attack!
  .
  -Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on
  everything in sight!
  .
  -Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive
  bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and
  utilize "Risk Shots" to string together combos and increase your score
  multiplier!
  .
  -Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance
  and actions taken during missions!

  Only you, the mages who live in the Grey Zone,  can see both incoming disasters,
  simultaneous and inevitable. Only you recognize the field of stars in someone's
  eyes as a sign of Dualism, the worship of these twin singularities. Three
  hundred years of history sits on your shoulders, and most people don't even
  believe the threat exists.
  .
  Only in the Grey Zone, between the Confederation of the Cosmic All and the
  Meritocratic Republic of Syble, do the four types of mages mix.   The people who
  come to the Grey Zone are rebels, heretics, pioneers and mercenaries.  Some want
  to build a shining city in the wastes, others just want to live another day.
  .
  At the heart of the Grey Zone lies the planet Exaltation, your home.  It is the
  only habitable planet in the system of Deviance, ruled by the Quantum Circle, a
  group of mages that view the Goddess as a force of chaos.  Everyone is free to
  use whatever substances they please, and hedonism is rampant.
  .
  But only here can you see a threat so powerful that it echoes back from the
  future, and only here can you stop it. If you fail, magic is doomed, the Goddess
  will die, and the cold war between the Confederation and the Meritocracy is
  going to turn very, very hot indeed.
  .
  With the power of the River of Stars and the Cosmic Deck at your fingertips, and
  a little luck, may you prevail!
  .
  The River features:
  .
  Galaxy-spanning science fantasy!
  .
  Diceless, non-random resolution for non-magickal tasks
  .
  Two completely different core magick systems!
  .
  Card based resolution mechanics for magick! Both magic systems use the same deck
  of ordinary playing cards (plus jokers) -- mages just use their hand and the
  Cosmic River very differently
  .
  Four Charts (playbooks), two for each type of magic, which further twist the way
  you control the universe: Weavers, Touched, Slicers, and Talented
  .
  Ordinary people empowered by a twin disaster echoing backward through time!
  .
  Playable with 1 GM and 2 or more additional players
  .
  NOTE: This game is under development. What you're seeing here is an early, but

  A village stricken by tragedy. A group of plucky young fishers. An ancient

  Welcome to Rod, Reel, & Fist.
  .
  A Tabletop Fishing RPG?! Rod, Reel, & Fist is 280+ pages of tabletop fishing
  adventure. Players take on the roles of heroic fishers trying to save their
  village by making a truly legendary catch.

  system makes all failures into temporary setbacks. At the same time, it's built
  to scale up and provide a challenge for seasoned players, and it comes with a
  host of alternate settings that reflavor the game as a space opera, cyberpunk
  adventure, or a martial arts odyssey.
  .
  Simple But Deep: Catch fish and ward off hostile animals using a "rock, paper,
  scissors, dice" combat system that relies on clever resource management, reading
  your opponent, weighing risk versus reward, and knowing when to step back and

  evolving adventuring region to which the players must return multiple times in
  order to fully conquer it.

game: Rodents With Guitars (USA)

developer: Plotbunny Games
publisher: Plotbunny Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  "It's the Rodent Records Guitar Band Battle!
  .
  You're going to give the greatest show the world has ever seen
  .
  and win absolutely epically.
  .
  Two things:
  .
  1. You have a plan for a complex show that requires precise timing and excellent
  teamwork. 2. You are goddamn rodents."
  .
  ~~~
  .
  "Rodents with Guitars" is a role-playing game for 2-5 players and 1 GM. It's no-
  prep/low-prep and perfect for one-shots.
  .
  It uses 1-2 six-sided dice (D6) to play. To pick from a bunch of lists during
  setup, you also  need D8 and D12 (or you can just choose items without rolling).
  .
  "Rodents with Guitars" is a hack of Grant Howitt's Honey Heist.
  .
  ~~~
  .
  What do I get?
  .
  The game has four A5 pages. You get one PDF with single pages and one PDF with
  spreads that can be printed double-sided onto A4 paper and folded into a mini
  zine. So, technically, it's still a one-page game. With a lot of rodent puns.
  .
  And because you can obviously never have enough rodents with guitars, you also
  get a PDF with a postcard-sized (A6) image of a rocking rat with a blank space
  to draw your own awesome guitar!
  .
  To make the game more accessible, there's also an HTML version of the entire
  game (minus the postcard) that you can download and open in a browser of your
  choice (instructions are included in the ZIP).
  .
  You get all of this in English as well as in German.
  .
  Please note that the spreads PDF is formatted in DIN A4. You may need to adjust
  your printer settings ("scale to fit") if you use a different paper format.
  .

  .
  Rodents with Guitars has been played on MeaslyMeatloaf's Bag of Tricks under the
  title ITCHY TABLE: The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Stilton:

  The game has also been mentioned in this Polygon article about the Queer Games

  "Es ist der Rodent Records Guitar Band Battle!
  .
  Ihr werdet das tollste Konzert abliefern, das die Welt je gesehen hat, und
  absolut episch gewinnen.
  .
  Zwei Dinge:
  .
  1. Ihr habt einen Plan fr eine komplexe Show, die przises Timing und exzellentes
  Teamwork erfordert. 2. Ihr seid verdammte Nagetiere."
  .
  ~~~
  .
  "Nagetiere mit Gitarren" ist ein Rollenspiel fr 2-6 Spielende und 1
  Spielleitung. Es braucht wenig bis keine Vorbereitung und ist perfekt fr
  Oneshots.
  .
  Zum Spielen braucht ihr 1-2 sechsseitige Wrfel (W6). Fr die Auswahllisten zu
  Spielbeginn braucht ihr auerdem W8 und W12 (oder ihr sucht einfach Dinge ohne zu
  wrfeln aus).
  .
  "Nagetiere mit Gitarren" ist ein Hack von Grant Howitts Honey Heist.
  .
  ~~~
  .
  Was bekomme ich?
  .
  Das Spiel hat vier A5-Seiten. Du bekommst ein PDF mit einzelnen Seiten und ein
  PDF mit Doppelseiten, die du beidseitig auf A4-Papier ausdrucken und in ein
  Mini-Zine falten kannst. Technisch gesprochen ist es also immer noch ein
  einseitiges Spiel. Mit sehr vielen Nagetier-Wortwitzen.
  .
  Und weil man offensichtlich nie genug Nagetiere mit Gitarren haben kann,
  bekommst du auerdem ein PDF mit einem postkartengroen (A6) Bild von einer
  rockenden Ratte mit Platz, um deine eigene coole Gitarre zu zeichnen!
  .
  Um das Spiel barrierefreier zu machen, gibt es weiterhin eine HTML-Version des
  gesamten Spiels (ausgenommen die Postkarte), die du herunterladen und in einem
  Browser deiner Wahl ffnen kannst (eine Anleitung dafr ist im ZIP enthalten).
  .
  All dies bekommst du sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch.
  .
  Beachte bitte, dass das Doppelseiten-PDF auf DIN A4 formatiert ist. Eventuell
  musst du deine Druckereinstellungen anpassen ("auf Seite anpassen"), wenn du ein
  anderes Papierformat benutzt.

  ROOM EXPLORER 2010: DELUXE LOVER'S PAQUE is a DELUXE paque for lovers that
  features many DELUXE goodies for fans of the 2021 PC game ROOM EXPLORER 2010. I
  have constructed it as somewhat of a "deconstructed art-book". a beautiful
  DELUXE trek through the creation of my first real videogame for the computer.
  .
  DELUXE Contents:
  .
  A very lightly retouched windows build of RXP2010, based off the previously WET
  GAMIN exclusive HTML5 build.
  .
  The full RXP2010 source code For Gamemaker Studio 2. In all its  un-commented
  beauty.
  .
  All original image and sound assets from the game. Sorted into folders for your
  convenience.
  .
  A variety of TXT files that describe the history or otherwise give commentary on
  most of the aforementioned assets. Also for your convenience.
  .
  A larger variety of screenshots that were taken during the game's development.
  Many oddities to be seen. Not all of them directly depicting the game's
  development, but most of them likely affecting it or being an effect of it in
  some way.
  .
  The original PSD files for all assets that have one!
  .
  A 1 hour long modular synthesizer jam session, from someone who has never
  touched  a modular setup before recording it (me). It only appears as a 5 second
  soundbite in the HTML5 build.
  .
  And a few much less exciting things that I don't feel the need to list here.
  .
  Overall, due to my inexperience at the time I was constructing this game, I
  don't think the contents will be very - strictly speaking - "useful" to anyone.
  But I hope they prove to be insightful or at the very least interesting. Thanks!
  .
  note: the version of RXP2010 and its related contents within have been lightly
  changed for this DELUXE paque. for various reasons, largely to make it purchase-
  for-money-able. I think what was changed should be pretty obvious if the
  original is still fresh in memory.
  .
  (warning: this game contains some [non-pointed, nobody's hurting anyone else]
  cartoon depictions of injury.)

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Rosette Diceless is an approach to roleplaying that focuses on collaborative
  storytelling and consent-based conflict resolution. You can roleplay everything
  from complex combat to intricate political debate with the same set of simple,
  quick-playing rules that work equally well for a tabletop game as they do for a
  LARP.
  .
  With Rosette Diceless you can take part in games with many more players than are
  practical for many roleplaying systems. You can easily split into groups without
  dividing the attention of a single game master. There's no randomness; challenge
  resolution is simple and based on resource expenditure, understanding your
  target's strategies, and setting up story to enable your success.
  .
  Rosette Diceless has an agenda: it is dedicated to a consensus-based, story-
  first, and improvisational approach. We believe that this creates the best
  social environment for creating and expressing stories that incorporate
  everyone's creativity.
  .
  "this is it. this is the type of thing i'm looking for. something with more
  ambition than sense, and enough sense to strangle god." - an itch.io user's
  collection note
  .
  Rosette Diceless is a complete, standalone book containing the core principles,
  character creation and advancement rules, conflict resolution system, and story-
  running techniques for GM-less games.
  .
  Rosette Diceless is now at version 1.0.1. For a list of changes since the
  initial release, download the errata from this page.
  .
  For additional guidance and supplemental materials, including new Traits and
  optional rules, check out the Rosette Diceless website.

  You love Critical Role, you laugh at The Adventure Zone; or you never listened
  to any actual play show or stream, but you keep hearing about this game of
  Dragons and Dungeons on the grapevine and Netflix.
  .
  This game seems super-fun and enables good banter and drama. You want to try
  that!
  .
  You do some googling, and find out they are asking you 30 bucks for an intro
  kit? And it is a limited item? And if you then get one, they expect you have to
  drop another 100 on three books and dice and what not? And seriously, you need
  to read all that before you try that? Come on, you don't even know if you like
  to play roleplaying games! You just want to try it.
  .
  I wrote this game for you.
  .
  Ruby Radiance was designed to be an entry point for newcomers, your gateway into
  roleplaying. It is meant to be accessible, low-commitment, and easy to learn. It
  is not meant to emulate any Hasbro product or the trappings of OSR; instead, it
  focuses on the modern podcasting and streaming media. We know you come into the
  hobby with certain expectations and this game was designed to provide those.
  .
  Every element of Ruby Radiance has been adjusted to bring the same exactly type
  of drama and hijinks you may have enjoyed in other media. T
  .
  Features of Ruby Radiance:
  .
  Self-contained intro; all you need to try your first rpg experience is on this
  document.
  .
  Magic available to all characters, because that is what you are here for.
  .
  A simple to learn, dramatic, tense combat system built upon the revolutionary
  Trophy Gold engine.
  .
  Gachapon rewards to get from your friends between quests!
  .
  Over 100 single use magic items and ways to customize your own Iconic Item.
  .
  A meaningful class and level system expanding upon Trophy Gold's framework.
  .
  Shared spotlight mechanics, and Drama as the focus of character and story
  progression.
  .
  Streamlined systems that help new players to organise games organically, from
  individual characters to massive campaign arcs.
  .
  "The Roaring Valley", a simple framework for adventure if you don't want to
  create your own or play in the world of your favorite show.
  .
  But wait! There is more.
  .
  20 community copies of the game will be made available for someone else to pick
  it for FREE. These are meant for those experiencing poverty and/or of
  marginalised communities.  For each copy of this game sold, I will be adding an
  additional free community copy.
  .
  The game is listed as "in development" as a promise. If this experience works,
  if people are getting into the hobby this way, I want to keep developing this
  game. I will release more content to Ruby Radiance AND keep working on more
  projects.  I would love to get a co-op going around this work, do more writers,
  hire more people to expand content, and damn right I would love to expand the
  Roaring Valley into a full-blown setting!
  .
  This is the 6e Edition of the game.
  .
  - More Art! So Much Art!
  .
  - New Layout.
  .
  - Expanded Roaring Valley setting.
  .
  - A beginner adventure set in the Roaring Valley setting.
  .
  - Expanded drama rules.
  .
  - The 6e edition of the game: just use regular dice! Easier than ever to play
  this game.
  .
  You can find the previous edition of the game (Zine edition) as a demo

  "Thanks for trying out the latest dimension in Game Boy games!"
  .
  For April Fools Day 2020, I took my GB Studio project, "Rulent Tower", the
  adventures of a bunch of parody furry characters in an apartment building
  together, and "converted" it to VR. I only had a few days to smash it together,
  so the scope had to be restrictive, and a lot of things were left on the table.
  After April Fools, I spent a few extras weeks tinkering with the project, until
  I was satisfied.
  .
  But it's now 2021, and Oculus has released the Quest 2, running at 120 Hz
  (effectively 120 Frames per Second)! The original Quest version was locked at 72
  Hz. The change itself was relatively simple (once I could find the information),
  but I decided to add in a few small adjustments and additional Easter Eggs. And
  then something went very wrong and I basically had to redo the process all over
  again. Learning!
  .
  This is a 5 minute gimmicky prototype. There isn't a ton to do here, as it's
  more about the novelty of seeing these pixel graphics converted to voxel and
  presented as if you were actually there in GB Land. There's a few oversized
  props you can play with, and maybe an easter egg or two, if you poke around.
  .
  There are two versions available. One was built for PC VR hardware, the other
  built specifically for Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 (and can run untethered).
  You'll need to sideload the APK for the Quest and Quest 2, but there's an easy-
  to-follow tutorial linked in the included Readme if you've never done that
  before.
  .
  [Controls:]
  .
  Point your blocky mitts at something that interests you. If it's interactive,
  the small dark green beams will switch to light green. You can grab objects from
  anywhere those beams can point at by pressing the trigger button, so don't worry
  about things being out of reach. Anything in your hands can be rotated by
  tilting the analog sticks Left or Right, and moved closer or further away from
  you by tilting those sticks Back or Forward. You can teleport around the lobby
  and hallway by pointing the mini voxel foxel at your desired floor location and
  pressing the trigger button.
  .
  There's no in-game menu, so on PC if you want to Reset the Scene, hit "R" on
  your keyboard. If you want to close the game, use your VR overlay's Close
  Software function, or tap "Esc" on your keyboard. If you can't do either of
  these things, I'm sorry but I've accidentally trapped you in blocky greenscale
  virtual reality. I promised myself I'd stop doing this...
  .
  [Supporters:]
  .
  I want to thank my Patrons and other Awesome and Amazing Supporters who make
  this stuff possible, including:
  .
  Sofox (knock to thank him!), Commander D, Darkdekumon, A. Kitty, Jeffrey Perigo,
  Jessica Bumpus, MaskRider, Matt Schock, and braedon benson

  You wanna run? You wanna jump? You're gonna fail. Again. And Again. But its fun
  to fail...right? Take control of HappyMan and hop skip and jump your way past
  low walls, big balls and spinning red things! A bunch of obstacles await, so get
  to it.
  .
  Run Jump Fail puts you in control of the hapless HappyMan, and tasks you with
  guiding him through a whole load of treacherous obstacle courses. You'll fail a
  lot along the way, but watching HappyMan collapse and flail when he's just run
  into a wall, or tripped on a ledge, or been hit by a big red spinning thing is a
  lot of fun.
  .
  Seriously, failing is 90% of the fun. So fail away.
  .
  The game is a 3D platformer that's dead simple to pick up and play in short
  bursts, so if you need a break from grinding away at the latest 50 hour epic RPG
  and fancy a spot of fun filled action, look no further.
  .
  Obligatory feature list:
  .
  Unique physics based 3D platforming action.

  Ragdolls!

  Explore the expansive region of Thebryll, a place filled with many dangers and
  secrets while collecting over 40 different items to aid you on your journey to
  find the six fragments of the Eternity Rune before it's too late!
  .
  The Story
  .
  Long ago, the wizard Odu created two magical runes to balance the natural forces
  of good and evil in the universe. They became known as the Runes of Eternity and
  Destruction, and were sealed away after Odu's passing.
  .
  Eventually, another wizard named Drodu stole the Rune of Destruction from its
  resting place. He was promised strange new powers by the rune, and it corrupted
  him. The Eternity Rune was broken into six pieces and scattered throughout
  Thebryll, leaving the now corrupted Drodu to go into hiding to master his
  newfound powers, confident he could not be stopped.
  .
  Odu arose from his grave, and knowing that the world could meet its doom, looked
  for someone to send on a mission to recover the pieces of the Eternity Rune. He
  eventually found Aloe, a warrior from the forest. Aloe was dubbed the title of
  "Rune Seeker" and was sent on his journey to reassemble the Rune of Eternity and
  save Thebryll.

  In a long forgotten age, a raging war shattered and devastated the worlds of
  gods and men. Now green life blooms amidst the ruins of the lost worlds.
  Wondrous and terrible beings roam the Nine Realms. Civilisation stumbles
  forward, fresh and reaching.
  .
  Fate carves the skein anew but there are loose threads, lost long ago in the
  wars, with no place in the tapestry. These threads must seek the fire within and
  weave their own path.
  .
  Strap on your bearded axe and linden wood shield, delve into the forsaken barrow
  and cleanse the draugr within. They will overhwhelm you at first so prepare to
  die. But when you wake up at the bonfire, you'll know what to expect for your
  next attempt. Parry their attacks, disarm them, and hack them to pieces. Defeat
  the mad jotunn within and claim the soul remnant they protect.
  .
  Death is not the end.
  .
  Runecairn: Core Rules is a 44-page, black and white tabletop RPG zine, which
  includes a Norse fantasy setting, a full game system, and character creation
  rules for adventures set after Ragnarok destroyed most of the Nine Realms of
  Norse mythology. Runecairn is based on Cairn by Yochai Gal, with streamlined
  rules, fast character creation, and gameplay based on exploration and player
  choice.
  .

  .
  Play designed for two players, one Warden and one Adventurer.
  .
  Full rules for play, based on the streamlined Cairn system and with mechanics
  inspired by the Dark Souls game series.
  .
  Death is not the end as Adventurers re-awaken at a bonfire when slain.
  .
  Four starting classes with unique weapon and item abilities: the hearty warrior
  with an axe and shield, the nimble scout with dual knives, the cunning seer with
  a staff and runestone magic, and the spirited skald whose voice channels the
  power of the gods.
  .
  Dynamic combat filled with devastating weapons, reactive magic, and reactive
  abilities.
  .
  30 forceful runestones spells for the cunning seer and 26 versatile sagas for
  the resolute skald.
  .
  15 unnerving and mysterious monsters drawn from tales of Norse mythology.
  .
  Illustrated throughout with evocative black and white line-art.

  What Others Have Said
  .
  Chris McDowall (@Bastionland), designer and creator of Into the Odd and Electric
  Bastionland:
  .
  I absolutely love Runecairn! As soon as I read it I wanted to steal its ideas.
  It changed the way I think about the type of games that the Into the Odd system
  can run.
  .
  Rich August (@RpgAugust), designer and writer at Steamforged Games (Dark Souls:
  The Roleplaying Game):
  .
  Thank you for such an awesome game - I loved reading Runecairn and it's on my
  list of 2022 games to get to the table. And the layout is lovely too.
  .
  Richard Kelly (@SprintingOwl), designer:
  .
  If you're looking for a moderately crunchy duo TRPG, or if you're a fan of Souls
  games, or if you want to see a stellar adaptation of video game mechanics to
  tabletop, I would strongly recommend giving Beneath the Broken Sword (and
  Runecairn) a shot.
  .
  Sebrina Calkins (@EntwifeXP), reviewer:
  .
  This is a quality game, adapting Cairn to an apocalyptic Norse setting with a
  greater emphasis on arms, armour and combat without losing the deadly and
  considered tone of its forebear.
  .
  Also now available, Runecairn: Wardensaga, a deluxe collected edition that

  IT'S STORYTIME
  .
  There was a time when The Agent was one of the most ass-kickingest special
  operatives on the block. Now, he's just your reclusive grandfather who doesn't
  give anyone the time of day - or didn't, until now. After granddad opens up to
  your mother again following years of solitude, you find yourself standing in
  front of his manor one rainy day for a weekend visit.
  .
  What follows is a tense, action-packed adventure spanning the various decades of
  The Agent's career. Acid-washed maniacs, a hulking mute with a gatling gun,
  tanks and soldiers and dogs - these only scratch the surface of the roller
  coaster.
  .
  Buckle up, baby: things are gonna get a touch rowdy.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Zero to sixty - experience low-key tension one moment and explosive mayhem the
  next. Be ready for anything.
  .
  Watch your step - You're a normal human! You can only take so much punishment. A
  few bullets and you're toast. Explosions? Forget it! You're dead! Be careful not
  to kill yourself with your own grenades, or accidentally shoot destructible
  objects while you're standing right next to 'em.
  .
  Roll, Gun, Roll! - Don't expect to waltz your way into a crowd of soldiers or
  guards and come out the other side unscathed unless you kick ass - a group of
  enemies will quickly overwhelm you unless you've mastered the art of rollin' and
  gunnin'!
  .
  Reactive environment - Most things explode, to your advantage and also to your
  detriment. So just - be careful, all right?
  .
  Be ready to die - SOS is full of tough bosses. You might wanna scream, and we
  encourage it because screaming is good for you!
  .
  AGENT THROUGH THE YEARS
  .
  Your grandfather's got some wild stories, kiddo! Different objects in his study
  trigger them. Each one features new characters, time periods, and narratives
  from the Agent's decades-long career. SOS launches with two exciting stories:
  .
  (1982) MIGHT OF THE STEEL HAND: Take down insane whackjob Lt. Fanibhusan and the
  Steel Hand Army before they wreck an unstable region's only hope at peace!
  .
  (1987) SIERRA NEVER: When a leading science lab goes rogue and kidnaps the Order
  of the Green's Dr. Brooke, it's up to Agent to infiltrate the compound and
  rescue her. Rumor has it an old friend is hot on the Agent's trail and seeking
  the good Doctor for his own gains...

  presence is now but a lost memory, the machines remain, determined to find this

  explore this beautiful realm, harness the power that still lingers here, and
  uncover its dark past. Stop the machines. Protect the land. Save the forest.

  Deep in the heart of an orcish homeland, torn apart by roving adventurers and
  power-hungry imperialists, a drow slave and a lone orc trek across hostile
  territory to exact revenge on an adventuring party for a history of violences
  committed against them and their people...
  .
  ---
  .
  Savage Blood is a story-game for 1-5 players about revenge and colonial
  ultraviolence - a revisionist fantasy story that flips the script and humanizes
  the plight and homogenization of the drow and orc civilizations by the dominant
  "races", especially in lieu of the real-world allusions to real-life
  colonization and racism present in traditional fantasy genre.
  .
  This game is best played with the intention to explore the darker side of
  adventuring parties in a culture that rewards treasure-hunting loners
  trespassing into the homelands of other civilizations and killing whoever they
  deem hostile.
  .
  It can also be used as a light worldbuilding exercise to add complexity to your
  existing fantasy world or campaign.
  .
  Savage Blood uses an intuitive technique of discovering/divining a story through
  the usage of art/tarot/oracle decks developed by @temporalhiccup in Stories Of
  Love in Manila.This game also takes heavy design inspiration from Archangel
  Dating Simulator by @mariamison.
  .

  .
  This game is directly inspired by recent Orcs discourse on Twitter and The
  Nightingale (2018), a revenge movie directed by Jennifer Kent which deals with
  the exact same themes.

  Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites is a narrative RPG about spending your night in
  one of the only clubs in your city that's safe for creatures of the night like
  yourself. All you want to do is have some fun just like the humans do. Play a
  supernatural creature of choice, put some sick EDM on the speakers and get your
  game on!
  .
  What you need in order to play:
  .
  An even number of players. 2-6 would be optimal.
  .
  Tokens, or things that can be used as tokens
  .
  Four-sided dice (d4), six-sided dice (d6), eight-sided dice (d8), ten-sided dice
  (d10), and twelve-sided dice (d12). You can share, but it'd be good if each
  player had their own set!
  .
  Some paper and things to write with in order to keep track of stuff easier.
  .
  No GM needed for this one! This game is designed to make all of you storytellers
  with an equal stake in how the story of your night(s) together go.
  .
  The basic premise of this game involves all of your characters hanging around at
  the same, supernaturals only place after dark - a night club, a concert, a bar,
  a coffeeshop, wherever you fancy as players. For one reason or another, you're
  there to unwind, chill, and maybe - just maybe, find somebody to spend the night
  with. Each of you interact with each other by choosing the way you approach each
  other,  rolling to see how successful you were, then narrating how scenes go
  based on the results. You'll show each other your character's approval for how
  well the flirting is going by giving each other tokens. You'll also be able to
  spend tokens to make sure conditions in the club are just right.

  it's ready to go.  It's an engine with complex stakes - the kind of thing you
  might see in a Powered by the Apocalypse game, but built on the fly with a
  "stakes sheet" in the center of the table:
  .
  When you want this engine powering your game:
  .
  If you expect your game to have moments where there's plenty going on, where
  there are three different things going on to worry about and two different
  awesome things the character could be doing, and you don't feel like sitting
  there for ten minutes making a roll for each single thing... That's the ideal
  moment to be using Schema, because it is better at handling that than any other
  system.
  .
  If you'd like to see characters needing to pick in the heat of the moment
  between bringing down the house or feeling sure they're going to come out in one
  piece... and if "Are you more okay with collateral damage on this one, or more
  okay with getting knocked off the roof and the bad guy getting away?" strikes
  you as a fun thing to happen in a roll, then you should use Schema.
  .
  If you want to characters to feel like they're patiently slogging it out when
  they're keeping their heads down, and throwing it all to the wind when they
  really care about what there is to gain, you want Schema.

  Now Old Scratch has invited you and your friends to wager in a game of his
  creation.

  Now you are chained to a card table with a few others who were in the running
  for "worst person alive" in a room lit by walls of fire. Turns out, "Old
  Scratch" is none other than the Devil himself, and y'all are playing for your
  very souls. Whoever wins will leave rich beyond their wildest dreams. Whoever
  loses won't leave at all. Will you profit from the misery of others? Give the
  Devil his due? Just remember: It's not about winning. It's about making everyone
  else lose.

  Scratch's Sc0re is a Rummy game in the style of Three Thirteen and Five Crowns.
  Make groups of cards called Talons out of your hand, while keeping more chips
  than your opponents. Clear first in a round and you can force the player you
  think did worst to pay up. Or wait for someone else to end the round and try to
  nab the ever-growing Score by bringing Old Scratch the card he most wants. Just
  be careful - every time someone claims The Score, it grows exponentially!

  Everything you need to play is included, besides up to five other people and a

  Reviews for The Search
  .
  Jay Is Games - "...as a puzzle game and a solo-venture at that, there is an
  incredible and impressive amount of love and polish in every moment. I was
  surprised, repeatedly, by several clever twists and turns...I could easily and
  gladly exist in The Search's liminality for hours longer, in its lovingly
  designed and beautifully rendered levels, its gorgeous, thoughtful soundtrack,
  and curious, otherworldly atmosphere."
  .
  Doctor's of Gaming - "The game is short, about an hour or two. But it was enough
  to impress me. It knows what it is, and executes that well. Pleasing visuals,
  good music/sound, an intriguing setting/story and fresh puzzles round out this
  surprising little gem."
  .
  GameRaven - "Big experiences can sometimes come in small packages and the time
  that you spend with The Search will be one that you will reflect on for days
  after you step away from it."

  Interior art from Clarissa Baut Stetson.
  .
  Seco Creek Vigilance Committee is an Old West RPG about justice, law, revenge,
  and the discrepancy between what is right and what is good. It's designed for
  intense, one-shot play with a non-random resolution system that emphasizes
  choices and their consequences.
  .
  Seco Creek is a game for five players and one Judge (the GM role). It plays in-
  between three to four hours in a single session. It requires access to the
  rules, character sheets, and four colors of poker chips.
  .
  Interior art from Clarissa Baut Stetson.
  .
  You play one of the five members of the posse that has captured the three
  outlaws. You decide if you want to do what the law says, what the people want,
  or what your gut thinks is right. You make choices and deal with their
  consequences. You determine what kind of world you want to live in - or die for.
  .
  Seco Creek was designed to emphasize these choices. We're not concerned with if
  a character can do something, but rather with what they're willing to endure in
  order to see it done.
  .
  When a player character takes an action that's plausible in the fiction, the
  Judge will determine the world's reaction. If the player accepts these
  consequences, the action occurs. The Judge determines the world's reaction based
  on the established fiction, and the character's Favor with the four Factions in
  the game - Townsfolk, Politicians, Businessmen and Outlaws.
  .
  Favor is an indicator of how well-respected, heeded, adored, or tolerated a
  player's character is by a particular Faction. Favor is represented by different
  colors of poker chips for each Faction. Player actions during the game will
  cause them to earn as well as lose Favor with these Factions. The higher a
  player's Favor, the more likely it is that members of the Faction will react
  positively to them. A character trying to quell an angry crowd of Townsfolk will
  have a much different reaction with two chips of Favor than with five.
  .
  As important as Favor is, it only applies to interactions with non-player
  characters. When player characters act upon each other, they engage the
  Negotiation mechanic. Much like with Favor, a player takes an action and is told
  the consequences necessary to make it true. In this case, rather than the Judge,
  it is the acted-upon player who determines the consequences. The acting player
  may accept, refuse, or continue to negotiate. Everything in the game, fictional
  and mechanical, is open to Negotiation and the acted-upon player should say what
  they truly want in order to allow the action to happen. This may be a little or
  a lot. It may be more than the acting player wants to give. The two players
  should try in earnest to find an agreed upon price, but if none can be found
  then the Judge takes over and narrates what happens - most often to the
  detriment of both characters. Seco Creek is no place for inaction.

description:
  Introducing the COMPLETE STORY of "Seduce Me", the popular English Dating Sim
  where you get to tell your story with a family of five demon brothers from the
  moment you meet the incubi to the day you say I do to your favorite incubus.
  This Complete Story includes "Seduce Me The Otome", "Seduce Me 2: The Demon
  War", 13 mini-episodes, and both Audio Otome CDs as well as a basic compendium
  for lore comprehension!
  .
  "It seemed like the start of something new. Something that would change."
  .
  You are a senior in high school along with your two best friends, Naomi
  Patterson and Suzu Cappini. You are also the granddaughter of Harold Anderson,
  the CEO and founder of Anderson Toys, a toy company sworn to give children
  amazing products and give a large part of their profit to charity.
  .
  One day, you get called home to attend your grandfather's funeral. After the
  funeral, you learn that you have inherited his large estate. Your father
  suggests you move in immediately, so the next day, you move out of your parents
  home and into your estate.
  .
  When you enter your new home, however, you see five injured, yet very handsome
  men on the lobby floor. They eventually awaken and make it known that they were
  attacked by a group of dangerous 'misfits' and ran to find shelter, passing out
  as soon as they entered your home.
  .
  You find out that they are incubi, 'demons who consume and use sexual energy of
  humans to survive'. With nowhere to go and a target on their backs, they ponder
  what what to do. Out of sympathy, you offer your home as refuge for a while in
  exchange for minor servitude (it is a big house, after all). They happily agree.
  .
  What will happen as the incubi get comfy? Why exactly did they come the human
  world? Who are the 'misfits', and will they stop pursuing them so the incubi can
  leave?
  .
  ...Will you WANT them to leave?

  Another AI finds themselves trapped by malevolent beings. This time it's far

  About the game
  .
  I wanted to make another game for some time. Mental health and other things
  stopped me from progressing as fast as I would have liked.
  .
  Now it's done. Another game, with a few improvements. Find old friends, new
  friends and even a boss fight!
  .
  You are always on a timer and have to look out for your health. Do you rush
  through or do you risk exploring?
  .
  Both choices have their advantages and both have their prizes!
  .
  I'm most proud of the boss fight. As it's something I've never done before and I
  think I did well.

  This text contains the following themes: violence, natural disasters, drowning,
  starvation, murder, kidnapping, war, familial conflict, violence against
  animals, the undead, characters exoticizing other cultures, and potentially mob
  violence. Of note, the story revolves around fantasy xenophobia that can be read
  as an allegory for anti-indigenous racism or colonialism.

  No jumping. Only falling.
  .
  Serious Scramblers is a fast-paced vertical platformer where you can't jump.
  Descend through a hazardous pit and defeat a massive monster lurking in the deep
  in this small but unabashedly tough game!
  .
  Fall your way through the super intense arcade action
  .
  Randomized level generation
  .
  Test your skills on challenging obstacles
  .
  Unlock new characters - each with game changing abilities
  .
  Get ready for the finale - MASSIVE BOSS FIGHT
  .
  Enjoy with some real sweet chip-tune music while playing the game
  .
  Serious Scramblers features a colorful cast of unlock-able characters, each
  changing the game in significant ways. Here are some examples:
  .
  Motoko - Time jumper
  .
  Like a certain innovative FPS, time only moves when Motoko moves. There is a
  catch however, the level scrolls a lot faster when time isn't paused - so,
  unless you want to get skewered by the ceiling spikes, you'll have to make each
  move carefully!
  .
  Silhouette - Gotta go fast
  .
  Silhouette moves at top speed at all times, so avoiding spike traps is as easy
  as A, B, and C! However, the trade-off is that there will be significantly
  lesser gold coins to collect.
  .
  Mummy - Gold Grabber
  .
  Fancy getting more coins to unlock more characters? Mummy's the one to choose.
  It's worth noting that Mummy is one of the slowest characters though!

  Session Zero is a game about characters.
  .
  It is the story of the life they have already lived before your story with them
  begins.
  .
  It is who they are, who has helped them, what has benefited them, and what has
  caused them harm.
  .
  Session Zero is a deck based, character creation game. Using a standard deck of
  cards or the deck of Session Zero cards, draw a hand and answer the prompts to
  create the story of your character from before your story with them began. Each
  unique prompt has a set of follow up questions to really get to the root of who
  this character is as well as the events and people who shaped their lives.
  .
  Designed as a solo game, it can easily be adapted to be played in groups within
  the same setting.
  .
  Downloadable content includes all files for both Session Zero and its expansion
  - rule and prompt pdfs (for play with a standard card deck), plain text versions
  of prompt lists, and individual files for all cards.

  Welcome to The Halfcut Hospital Trust!
  .
  Due to an unfortunate budgeting shortfall, we are sadly no longer able to
  provide separate uniforms for porters, nurses, doctors - or even patients!
  Everyone is now issued with daily sets of scrubs, which we can reuse again and
  again, saving the hospital lots of money which we can spend on management
  consultants patient care.

  Sadly, the entire staff of our laundry department has recently gone on strike -
  they are asking for something called "holiday pay" - so please bear with us if
  the quality of our cleaning is temporarily less than satisfactory.
  .
  You are a set of hospital scrubs.
  .
  You will live as that single set of scrubs through a daily change of wearers.
  Witness the wonder, sadness and drudgery that is the hospital experience. Slowly
  experience your material becoming stained, ripped, repaired and eventually
  discarded.

  Perhaps you will recognise a symmetry between your fragile cloth and the human
  lives around you?

developer: Naive Star
publisher: Naive Star
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Setealem: The Seventh Beyond is a game about staying sane in a hostile
  environment, stripped of all familiar comforts and using every available
  resource to increase your odds of survival. Despite all of this, it should be an
  adventure full of danger, mystery and wonder, as the characters discover the
  secrets of the deep forest, deal with tribes of spirits both friendly and
  hostile and meet and interact with creatures of local legend and folklore,
  adapted to your adventure by you and the players.
  .
  Setealem is a Brazilian version of the "twilight zone".  Chronicled by Luciano
  Milici, initially on an Orkut community (a social network that has since gone
  defunct), and later on his blog, the stories grew into urban legend status.
  There are tales in every part of the country and they are as varied as any myth,
  tied only by the eerie atmosphere and the name Setealem. This urban legend is
  the main inspiration for this game, as well as where it gets its name.
  .
  Besides drawing inspiration from myths and legends of Brazilian folklore, The
  Seventh Beyond also contains strong elements of classic britannian legends, Onyx
  Path's Changeling: the Lost and the open source game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead,
  among others.

description:
  Delve into a world of perilous exploits and horror!
  .
  Shattered is a self-contained tabletop RPG that is built on a unique die system
  providing players with a tangible sense of growth. Inhabit one of eight distinct
  races and explore the dangerous post-apocalyptic world of Feneryss. Millennia
  ago, millions sacrificed themselves in a ritual to the dark god, Ragnarok. The
  blood rite failed and rebounded on the planet, capsizing entire tectonic plates,
  replacing once plentiful oceans with molten rock, and calling down catastrophic
  storms to ravage what remained.
  .
  Battle monsters and master the varied ecosystems of Feneryss using a classless,
  XP-based progression system that puts you in control of your destiny. Craft
  weapons, armor, prosthetics- and more. Cast magic, use psychic powers, and call
  down the power of faith to level your opponents, all from atop an airship of
  your own design.
  .
  GMs can take full advantage of more than 50 pages of lore to develop a
  compelling story. Additionally, they can use the robust creature creation system
  as well as pages of advice to help make their campaign unforgettable.

  "Sheepless Nights - The Fun Way to Test Your Mathematical Skills!" -
  AskYourAndroid
  .
  "Let your kids study math easy with this relaxing game" - AppEggs
  .
  - Scroll down for the Rules of the game.
  .
  Sheepless Nights is an entertaining and educational (math) cardgame for kids
  (5+) and grownups.
  .
  Sheepless Nights helps your kids improve the ability of count. Not only fun for
  kids but also for their parents. The kids math cardgame provides you the time
  playing together with your children and make good communication with them. If
  you want your child enjoy learning math, there's no other better choice except
  for Sheepless Nights.
  .
  "If you ignore this game because you think it's just a kids' card game, you are
  missing out. It's equally fun for adults too. The rules of the game are unique,
  and you hardly notice you're doing math. You find yourself groaning when you
  receive a black sheep, and cheering when you are able to give it an opponent. I
  find myself whiling away the time playing this game. Fun!"
  .
  Rules of the game:
  .
  Each player will try to be the first to lose his cards. Remaining cards left
  .
  in the players hand  will count as points.
  .
  The game has 56 sheepcards  each a value from 1 up to 10,
  .
  5 shepherds, 5 wolves, 3 lucky lambs and 3 black sheep. Each player is dealt 7
  cards.
  .
  The remainder of the deck will be left face down. One sheepcard will then be
  revealed.
  .
  The player will take one of the following actions:
  .
  Play out an equal number sheepcard
  .
  Play two sheepcards by adding up the numbers
  .
  Play a special card
  .
  Take a card off the deck
  .
  Then it's the next player's turn.
  .
  Action 1 - Play out an equal sheepcard
  .
  The player will take one of the cards out of his hand with an equal value of the
  card showing and place their card on top on the pile.
  .
  Action 2 - Play two sheepcards by adding up the numbers.
  .
  A player can play two sheepcards at one time by calculating the value of the two
  cards in their hand and place them on the table pile.
  .
  For instance you can play a 1 and a 5. This is possible:
  .
  - when there is a 6 on the table pile:
  .
  6 - 5 = 1
  .
  - when there is a 4 on the table pile:
  .
  4 + 1 = 5
  .
  Action 3 - Play a special card
  .
  The special cards are: black sheep, the sheppard, the wolf and the lucky lamb.
  You can play these cards by putting them on the second table pile. The next
  action depends on the kind of special card you played...
  .
  - The lucky lamb
  .
  A lucky lamb can either take a value of any number from 1 to 10 when it is used
  in a sum or serves as an equal sheepcard.
  .
  - for example: 2 + * = 9
  .
  - The big bad wolf
  .
  When a player wants to play a wolf from his hand the next player will have to
  take a set of cards form the pile and take them in his hands. The player who
  played the wolf, will play another sheepcard. The value of this card defines the
  amount of cards that the next player will have to play. If the player who has to
  take cards immediately will play a wolf himself that buys him out to take extra
  cards. Now the next player will have to take the extra cards.
  .
  - The shepherd
  .
  This card can be played at any time if the previous player did not play the
  card. If a player plays this card then he will put it on the second table pile.
  The next player can only play an equal card (action 1) or take a card of the
  deck (action 4).
  .
  - The black sheep
  .
  Nobody wants a black sheep in his hand. Black sheep will give you many points.
  A black sheep can only be passed to another player if you have at hand a
  sheepcard with an equal value as the amount of cards at hand of the other
  player. When you put the black sheep card on the tablepile you can choose to
  give away the card to another player.
  .
  Finish the game
  .
  When the last card is played then the previous played cards will be
  automatically shuffeled and will make a new table pile.
  .
  A round is finished when a player has put his last card on the table pile or
  when he has only black sheep left. After this the points will be counted.
  .
  Counting points
  .
  For each player the remaining cards in their hand are added up:
  .
  for every sheepcard the value is counted
  .
  for every Shepherd, Lucky lamb or Wolf you will get 10 points
  .
  for every Black sheep you will get 15 points, but ...
  .
  if you have all three black sheep, then 30 points will be taken of the total!
  .
  The game is finished after 4 rounds. The player with the least points wins the
  game!

  The story behind Shell Out Showdown
  .
  Shell Out Showdown is part of what has retroactively been termed the "molasses
  jam" run by the Bay Area Dev Collective. The theme of the jam was to make a
  violent genre non-violent. I picked the last-person-standing, battle-royale
  genre, as it tends to be dominated by violent games, and Shell Out Showdown
  eventually came to life!

  yourself of the meanings of ante, check, bet, raise, and fold from poker and
  check from chess.

  Everything is alive, but how do you talk to it?
  .
  Shrug Island - The Meeting is a warmly wistful adventure, an open door into a
  playful celebration of music, mystery and nature's dances.  In a personal fusion
  of genres crafted by a small team of music and nature lovers, it's a game about
  hope, reconnecting friendship, and hidden pasts, featuring beautiful hand-drawn
  art and soundscapes.
  .
  The Watcher, keeper of the Island's balance, is losing their powers and calls
  for help. Delve into the adventure with two separated Shrug friends, Li and
  Shri, as they heed the call, exploring their shape-shifting musical landscape
  they've just returned to. Using their power to transform the land, by playing
  music or revealing a hidden layer of the world where forgotten things lie,
  combine their skills on a journey towards each other.
  .
  Key Character features:
  .
  - Psychic archeology
  .
  - Musical metamorphosis
  .
  Come away and spend an hour or two with the Shrugs on their lively home. Unravel
  riddles of groaning cliffs and puzzles of the past, where crispy crabs, sweeps
  of seaweed, flights of fish and more mysteries of Shrug time await your voice to
  speak.
  .
  Shrug Island - The Meeting can be played by a goal oriented adventure gamer in
  around an hour. Wanderers can take a more leisurely path and explore the
  changing season around the Island.
  .
  Shrug Island is an allegory on the many levels of identity, belonging, care and
  renewal.
  .
  "The lovely interplay between island, music, and the two playable shrugs was a
  ray of sunlight that I quite enjoyed basking in while it lasted.." - Merlina
  McGovern, Adventure Gamers
  .
  "Shrug Island - The Meeting draws the player into its colorful world, then lets
  them free to see what music can do in this enchanted place. While it can be
  finished quickly, it's well worth your while to lose yourself in its sights and
  sounds ." - Joel Couture, indiegames.com
  .
  "Shrug Island is a relaxing spiritual experience transmitting positive feelings:
  beauty, love, friendship, empathy, harmony with nature, childhood nostalgia." -
  Video Games Art
  .
  Shrug Island - The Meeting is a first commercially released  game based on an
  awarded animation film by Alina Constantin . Followed by many migrations,
  strawbale building, prototypes, a Kickstarter campaign, cultural grants and
  changing tides, you can look into the long gestation process on

  Fight yourself. Die Trying.
  .
  == Both of our FREE content updates - SHUTDOWN and SHUT UP - are now live! ==
  .
  == Play the free demo HERE ==
  .
  SHUT IN is a dark comedy/psychological horror adventure game which explores
  depression and isolation by trapping you inside your own house.
  .
  Your task is simple: Get out of bed, go outside, and get some Fresh Air. Think
  you can handle that?
  .
  Oh, but it might not be quite that simple. Your house isn't looking quite like
  it used to. You don't recognise any of these photos, everything's gotten dirty
  and disgusting, cracks seem to be opening up everywhere, and you're SURE
  everything didn't used to be so... constantly trying to kill you.
  .
  Maybe it's not worth it. Maybe go back to bed. Try again tomorrow.
  .
  If you do decide to keep going, you'll have to face strange puzzles, bizarre and
  uncomfortable obstacles, and a narrator who is unreliable at best, and downright
  insulting at worst. You'll have to get through your day under a constant barrage
  of judgment, sarcasm, and melancholy. If you can cope with that. Idiot.
  .
  SHUT IN is about tension and discomfort in a familiar environment. Your greatest
  tools are also your worst enemies. Common sense will keep you alive, but it
  might not get you very far. Curiosity can have great rewards, but will probably
  just get you killed.
  .
  But don't worry. When you (inevitably) die - because you fell down the stairs,
  were too stupid to operate an oven properly, got ripped apart by untold
  invisible horror, something like that - you can always just give up. Try again
  tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next day.
  .
  Here's what people have been saying about the game:
  .
  "Tackles the subject of mental health in a really clever way... whilst striking
  the perfect balance with its dark comedy."
  .
  9.2/10 - Full Sync
  .
  "With depth far beyond the initial on-the-surface horror story, this experience
  taps into the evocativeness of a mental health crisis."
  .
  9/10 - Cubed3
  .
  "It's funny. It's darkly funny. It's cruelly funny." Buried Treasure
  .
  "Exploring themes of mental illness has certainly been done in games before, but
  SHUT IN does it exceptionally well."
  .
  4/5 - Adventure Gamers
  .
  "I've never felt more unintentionally *seen* by a video game before."
  HeyPoorPlayer
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  Over a dozen unique ways to die!
  .
  Probably a way to survive!
  .
  Original atmospheric horror soundtrack by composer Luc Wilkinson.
  .
  Everything else done by person/mess Cael O'Sullivan.
  .
  A dangerous house full of original puzzles, and loads of ways to get them wrong!
  .
  A hint system which isn't that helpful, and often insults you!
  .
  Multiple items to experiment with, each with tons of unique interactions that
  solve no puzzles and achieve nothing.
  .
  Option to just stay in bed forever!
  .
  Quite short, so it's over quicker!
  .
  Writing up these features is exhausting...
  .
  Try again tomorrow.

  .
  Signs of the Sojourner is a narrative deck-building game about connecting and
  communicating with others. It breaks away from typical card-battlers by instead
  challenging you to understand different perspectives and navigate social
  situations.
  .
  Your deck is your character, shaped by your experiences and relationships.
  Different decks will lead to different narrative paths as your cards impact your
  ability to communicate with various characters. Rather than building the most
  "powerful" deck, you will have to make decisions about who you want to be in
  this world and how you relate to others.
  .
  Set in a near-future earth-like world, you take over your mother's store after
  her death, traveling to diverse locations in order to acquire goods for the
  shop. This is a world where communities are more insulated, where travel is
  difficult, and where climate change has made life hard, but you'll still
  encounter optimistic stories, compassionate characters, and delightful
  surprises.

  You open your eyes, and find the whole world broken;
  .
  the past you knew washed away in blood and fire,
  .
  and the world all but consumed by the Sins of our Fathers.
  .
  The Song of the Mother denies the dead their rest,
  .
  and they howl for the communion of all flesh; the end of mankind.
  .
  Slavers scour the wastelands looking for the unfortunate and unwanted,
  .
  wars of faith consume what remains of humanity's precious resources,
  .
  and the cults of long forgotten gods rise to prominence
  .
  to proclaim their eldritch dominance once more.
  .
  By all rights, you should close your eyes again,
  .
  and let the comforting darkness of Mother's Song consume you.
  .
  However, you, and those like you, are different.
  .
  Against all odds, you fight back against the dying of the light.
  .
  You hold on to what it is that makes you human.
  .
  Against the onslaught of the coming darkness,
  .
  you refuse to yield, refuse to die,

  The path ahead isn't easy,

  You hold the power to drive back mankind's enemies, and the power to rule;

  To be a saviour, or a destroyer.

  Will you redeem mankind's Sins,

  or draw us forever into the Darkness?

  One thing is certain;
  .
  Your story is only just beginning.

  Dominating the supernatural post-apocalypse genre, SINS is a narrative role-
  playing game focused on telling the stories of powerful entities - known as
  Nemissaries - in the ruins of 22nd Century Earth. These reborn individuals are
  people of immense will, who have dragged themselves back from the brink of
  death, and returned with a wealth of mysterious powers with which to fight the
  undying hive-mind known only as the Brood.
  .
  SINS utilises a D6-based dice pool engine, built around fluidity, narrative
  play, and character development. Players take on the role of Nemissaries -
  beings of monumental strength that hold the power to restore and rebuild the
  world as they see fit. Their powers come at great cost however, and every
  Nemissary must wage a personal battle with their inner demons to maintain their
  strength. The world of SINS is full of a great many mysteries, and only through
  personal development and moral strife will the Nemissaries uncover them all.
  .
  This is the 360 page .PDF core rules, containing everything from;

  SINS' variant of the HOPE engine, First Falling Leaf's signature RPG engine
  .
  Hundreds of pages of rich lore and world-building

  You've found both tibias, both fibulas, and all those pesky little phalanges.
  But you're not done yet! You're still deep in the dungeon with the clinking and
  clunking, the grinding and gnashing of the angry fortress standing between you
  and freedom. And don't think the bonepile is going to give up that easy.
  .
  So be quick, run as fast as your bony little legs will carry you, And, no matter
  what, don't give up, skeleton!

  Skelerun is a randomly generated platformer where you race against the clock to
  escape a dungeon littered with all manner of tricks, traps, and hazards before
  the way out slams closed.

  "If you're going to write a game about serial killers ... play this one first."
  -fia glas
  .
  Your name was on the front page. You were a victim with a number. One, two,
  three, four, five. When they caught him, your Killer's full name was splashed
  across the front page too, along with smaller pictures of the rest of his
  victims. They wrote hundreds of words dedicated to his motives: what he wanted,
  why he wanted it, how could such a monster exist among us. You were relegated to
  his kills, his trophies. He captured the public imagination.
  .
  They haven't heard you since you went missing. Your voice was snuffed out, or
  added to the background noise of the Killer's glamour. You became a part of him,
  part of his past, his present, and his future.
  .
  A feminine horror LARP about reclaiming your personhood in the face of someone
  who wants to take it away, even beyond death.

  Tips and Tricks
  .
  Go easy on the weapons! Their stats and abilities don't stack, so it's a waste
  of precious space. Equip just one or two, and support them with artifacts.
  .
  With multiple weapons equipped (like a sword and a whip, in this example), use
  the number keys to select between them. Only one may be used at a time.
  .
  Kite enemies whenever possible! Attack while they're resting, and step away
  while they're not. You can do this repeatedly against anything slower than
  yourself.
  .
  Mouse over enemies to see their stats. Some have nasty abilities (like poison!)
  that will kill you if you aren't prepared. You can also see their speed and
  remaining HP.
  .
  Throw potions at enemies and bosses! A well-placed debuff like slowness or
  confusion can make difficult battles easy.
  .
  Your own effects can be viewed at the bottom right. Note that you cannot stack
  the same effect more than once at a time, so drinking two regeneration potions
  in a row is unhelpful.

description:
  Welcome to the collection of Skin Deep. What you will be getting with this
  product is: 12 Skins, 6 Small Towns, and new rules dealing with death; dying;
  and harm.
  .
  The skins you will be getting are as follows:
  .
  The Bakeneko Awkward, counterculture, confusing, and idiosyncratic. The Bakeneko
  is about not fitting into the mold and not really trying to.
  .
  The Bedlam Cunning, dreamy, heroic, and novel. The Bedlam is someone more afraid
  of growing up to wear business casual than being eaten by a giant spider.
  .
  The Devil Devious, enthralling, giving, and dependent. The Devil is about having
  favors to call in at the right moment - whether they were given willingly or
  just owed.
  .
  The Dragon Tempting, seductive, and popular. The Dragon demands attention
  wherever they go - good or bad.
  .
  The Ferret Witty, playful, lively, and short-sighted. The Ferret is the party
  animal who has everyone's best interests at heart - right after their own of
  course.
  .
  The Fomorian Alienated, terrifying, powerful, and unyielding. The Fomorian knows
  the world isn't fair and plans to tip the balance in their favor.
  .
  The Immortal Wise, lonely, and sophomoric. The Immortal likes to think they're
  grown up, that they've seen it all, that they know everything. This is patently
  untrue.
  .
  The Leshy Noble, wild, arrogant, and unsure. The Leshy rules over a world most
  people overlook or take for granted daily.
  .
  The Prometheus Smart, weird, focused, and a little bit on edge. The Prometheus
  knows just enough to be dangerous and not enough to be safe.
  .
  The Siren Seductive, charming, spoiled, and needy. The Siren is a diva-in-
  training with a voice that can't be ignored.
  .
  The Tengu Wild, hard-hitting, angry, and hurt. The Tengu is that bad boy or bad
  girl that is so wistfully talked about.
  .
  The Veela Dramatic, haughty, sultry, and manipulative. The Veela is a wannabe TV
  star with enough clout to back up their views.
  .
  In addition to these twelve skins you also get the small towns that were
  included in Skin Deep, the Ferret, and the Tengu releases plus a special small
  town specifically made for this product collection that plays off the Harvey
  Milk school and Monster Prom.
  .
  So add some new character to your Monsterhearts collection! Make the game less
  deadly! Enjoy your wonderful drama with Skin Deep extras.
  .
  Update: I have added quality of play enhancements to some of the Skins and will
  be updating a few more soon. The Bakeneko, Dragon, Fomorian, Immortal,
  Prometheus, & Veela have all been updated. Look for updates to the Ferret,
  Leshy, & Siren soon!

developer: Biscuit Fund Games
publisher: Biscuit Fund Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Skirmish is a tactical wargame depicting combat encounters between two small
  armies, battling either for objectives or for annihilation. Unlike similar
  wargames, however, Skirmish does not use miniatures or measurements, and is
  played entirely with dice and an eight-by-eight square grid. The aim is a
  wargame with a low barrier to entry that's accessible on a tight budget, with
  simple base rules but plenty of space to build on.
  .
  The Skirmish core rulebook features the Tamerlane Wars. Taking place on war-torn
  Tourlian, the industrialised war machine of the Mordaunt Empire clashes
  endlessly with the loosely aligned states of the Ventrasse Alliance. Though the
  endless Tamerlane Wars have now become the norm for the people of Tourlian, very
  few know that the war itself is the result of an coup d'etat by the Mordaunt
  prince-regent Beauregard - a means to both consolidate his power and stamp out
  the sorcerous traditions of Witch-Queen Ventrasse.
  .
  A spread from the rulebook, introducing the Ventrasse Alliance
  .
  Skirmish: Wallet Friendly Wargaming features:
  .
  20 armies to get right into combat with, ranging from assassins and cavalry to

publisher: Failbetter Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  "The windows of your locomotive are stained glass, spilling panes of
  .
  lush colour across you. In the High Wilderness, the light of the stars is
  .
  enchanting. Looking too long can stir consuming obsessions, or wild
  .
  fascinations. The coloured glass offers some small defence."
  .
  Queen Victoria has brought London into the heavens. The High Wilderness
  stretches out ahead of you; cruel, unwelcoming, and filled with opportunity.
  .
  Here you make your living as a Skyfarer, working on board a locomotive jury-
  rigged to fly through these cold skies and raging winds. Your captain has taken
  you to the Reach, a frontier on the edge of civilisation, in search of fame,
  fortune and adventure.
  .
  You will change out here, where the Empire's light falters and casts deep
  shadows, where rebels stake their claim on fragments of sky-rock riddled with
  fungus, where pillagers dig into ruins built by the now-dead sun.
  .
  Players form the crew of a spacefaring steam locomotive. Gunners,
  quartermasters, engineers, signallers - even mascots - are brought to the fore
  as the Captain is struck down by misfortune and the crew must band together to
  get out of (or into) many surprising kinds of trouble.
  .
  Using a simple dice-based system, Skyfarer allows players and gamemasters to
  easily tell stories set in the Fallen London universe with plenty of climactic
  moments, tense stand-offs, and grim decisions. As characters risk life and limb,
  they'll accrue Peril - the more Peril they have, the greater the chance of them
  meeting a grisly and permanent end.
  .
  Luckily, things are made easier by spending Tenacity - a resource earned by
  acting in accordance with your character's drives and beliefs. But how will
  those integrities change, now you're out on the frontier of Victoria's Empire?
  .
  Originally released in September 2018 to accompany the PC, Mac and Linux game
  Sunless Skies, Skyfarer is set in the Fallen London universe. It was written by
  Grant Howitt and Chris Taylor of Rowan, Rook and Decard, with narrative
  direction by Chris Gardiner of Failbetter Games. The additional story supplement
  is by Chris Gardiner.

  Slayers uses a simple 4+ system to create an action filled session that moves

  table.

game: Sleepaway (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/S/Sleepaway (USA)/Sleepaway (USA).json
developer: Possum Creek Games
publisher: Possum Creek Games
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Sleepaway gives us long hazy days, chilled summer nights, kids screaming and
  chasing fireflies, crackling campfires, and a gaunt, cruel monstrosity forever
  hiding just out of sight, always asking, "What do you do next?"
  .
  In Sleepaway, you play as a camp counselor at a not-so-ordinary summer camp
  besieged by a Strange and ominous cryptid. In the outside world, people grow
  increasingly alienated from their own identities, trapped in a miasma of
  advertising and corporate branding. Isolated from civilization, this summer camp
  is a beacon of safety, a refuge for misfit kids defined by their
  marginalization. As time pushes past and the world grows older, this camp also
  shelters the survivors of the Lindworm.
  .
  The Lindworm is a shapeshifter, or so the stories go; a creature that flays the
  skin of humans and hides within. As counselors of this summer camp, you've each
  been traumatized by the Lindworm, in your own ways.
  .
  You remember little of that time.
  .
  Just that you don't want anyone else to experience it either, and you'll keep
  this camp safe no matter what.
  .
  Sleepaway is a breathtaking piece of design. At its core it is the
  straightforward give-and-take economy of Avery Alder's Belonging Outside
  Belonging system. Around that core, Jay has built an elegant and unsettling
  scaffold of poetic prompts, relatable archetypes, and bogey-monster horror that
  facilitate a truly terrifying experience.
  .
  - Eric Mersmann
  .
  Sleepaway uses the Belonging Outside Belonging system, popularized by games like
  Dream Askew by Avery Alder and Dream Apart by Benjamin Rosenbaum. It is a
  diceless game where tokens are received for making Weak Moves (actions that make
  your life harder), and these tokens are spent on Strong Moves (actions that
  passionately succeed). In Belonging Outside Belonging games, everyone shares the
  role of facilitator, and each person can pick up Setting Elements to bounce off
  of and provide narrative impetus for the other players. In Sleepaway, Setting
  Elements also contain Rituals, in which gameplay becomes more abstracted, to
  highlight unique moments of play by combining them with real-world actions and
  activities. Rituals might invite you to draw, to gesticulate, to play music, or
  even to destroy elements of the game itself in very unique ways.
  .
  The story continues on this way, with characters interacting and setting
  elements providing a world to interact within, until it is time for the Lindworm
  to act. While everyone has their eyes closed, one player responsible for
  channeling the Lindworm during play draws from a deck of cards and causes an
  unsettling event to occur. These can range from a new scar in a place you didn't
  remember having one, to a brutally dismembered animal appearing at your cabin
  door, or potentially even the death or dismemberment of player characters as the
  game continue.
  .
  Characters, scenes, locations, items, and the Lindworm's cards are all kept
  track of on a conspiracy-style corkboard, which slowly becomes more entangled
  and more mechanically relevant over time.
  .
  The game is divided into three acts, each one with unique rules that subtly
  change the game by adding new setting elements, permanently changing setting
  elements and character sheets, and introducing new ways to play.
  .
  Sleepaway was a simultaneous nostalgia trip and horrifying art project. From
  designing our land (inevitably just like land we'd all been to) to interacting
  with fellow staff and campers, the whole experience deeply evoked my days at
  camp and the feeling of magic that came with them. These memories were like a
  canvas; on top of them we painted an atmospheric set of horrors, weaving scenes
  together out of remembrances and collective narrative understanding. At each
  point there was a sense that we all knew where the story should go - it was just
  a matter of following it there, of letting the Lindworm manifest it. It was
  satisfying and unique to layer dread on nostalgia, and I highly recommend it for
  anyone who remembers the magic of summer camp!

  .
  The Sleepaway book is 130 pages long, and features gorgeous black and white
  illustrations by our talented team of artists and graphic designers, based on
  the natural flora and fauna of the Hudson Valley, where the author grew up and
  where the summer camp Sleepaway is based on is located.
  .
  The book has ten unique character sheets, a dozen setting elements for multiple
  stages of play, rules for both oneshots and campaign play, an enormous pile of
  rituals, and so much more! Follow the link down below to purchase a physical
  copy of the Sleepaway book.
  .
  We each have fallen in love with the characters we build so fast, they feel like
  lovely little facets of ourselves; and the emphasis on struggle, of working
  through things, of making yourself vulnerable in order to be strong, has been so
  much fun and surprisingly healing.
  .
  - Vocea
  .
  With Sleepaway, Dragon takes the social mechanics of setting elements from
  Belonging outside Belonging games, and eases them deftly into the setting - and
  into the ald itself. It's a syncretic wedding between the natural world, the
  people who tend it, and the supernatural forces that inhabit it.

  .
  A beautiful PDF that's possibly the best game in the Belonging Outside Belonging
  system. It does exactly what it says it does, excellently. Protect the campers.
  Cause drama. Get flayed by the Lindworm.

  In a city brimming with secrets only one individual can cut through the smoke
  and make sense of it all.
  .
  Enter The Sleuth, a peerless detective and mentalist.
  .
  In every lie there exists a kernel of truth. In every stroke of the pen, a
  hundred words. In a city like Doskvol it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to
  the meaning of it all, to shut the door and allow the trash to pile up
  underneath the floorboards. The Sleuth knows that a foundation of lies drags
  everyone down and that is very useful information.

developer: The Bonsai Treehouse
publisher: The Bonsai Treehouse
genre: Racing
description:
  (Oct-10-2019) - UPDATE 1.0.0.1:
  .
  Dramatically decreased popping volume of small blue score balloons
  .
  Regressed control time bug in which players could regain time faster by
  repetitively pushing the left stick in any direction over and over.
  .
  Added additional details and names to the credits text document file.
  .
  Summary:
  .
  No control? No worries!
  .
  Ride inside one of 50 inflatable tubes that stick and ride together as one on
  contact all the way to the bottom of one tall mountain through multiple winding
  routes and areas! Pop as many balloons as possible to gain the most points as
  you race to the bottom! Playable with up to four players via local splitscreen,
  Snowdown boasts a casual pick-up-and-play focus with a low barrier to entry!
  .
  Remember: the only way is down!
  .
  Instructions:
  .
  Players each have a yellow Control Timer on their screen that slowly replenishes
  by itself when they aren't moving around. The higher the timer gets, the more
  control they can exert over their inflatable tube. However, when they start to
  move around, the timer will start to tick down to zero at which point they won't
  be able to move at all for a certain amount of time.
  .
  Riding through a Time Gate will grant more control time back for players who are
  able to reach it ahead of others and riding through yellow Hazard Rings will set
  a trap in one of the 36 different zones for other tubes currently riding through
  it! Players then get to watch the event play out in real time on a giant screen
  as the trapped tubes are scrambled in the chaos!
  .
  Inspired by rollercoaster action chase films, classic arcade titles of the 1990s
  and modern Battle Royale games, Snowdown is designed to exhibit a more "chilled-
  out" approach to traditional concepts of game flow, complimenting an idle brand
  of party atmosphere, allowing players the freedom to step back and let a session
  play out by itself and return later on or even let someone else take over if
  they so choose.
  .
  So hop in and crash, bash and slide your way into the biggest racing mosh ten
  thousand feet above! Hold on tight...now let go!

developer: Live Real Press
publisher: Live Real Press
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Do you remember what happened in the last game? Who saved which royalty? Who
  conquered which tavern? Who died laughing? Now, it doesn't matter. This is the
  game where people bet the lives gold to tell the most outrageous stories while
  the NPCs interrupt with their versions. It's a fantasy rumor mill.
  .
  So You're in a Tavern is about telling outrageous stories about adventures that
  are absolutely true in every way. It uses a deck of playing cards and a few
  tokens to help tell the tales and determine a winner. It can be played with a
  group or solo.
  .
  Players take turns drawing cards to prompt for an outrageous story. As the
  player tells their story, other players add wagers to change the story. "I'm
  sorry, Sir Pantsonfire, but wasn't it a giant daisy, not a fire-breathing
  dragon?" The player can accept the wager and incorporate the change or deny it
  by adding a coin of their own.
  .
  You need:
  .
  A deck of cards with the jokers removed.
  .
  Some tokens to bet with. Five per player is ideal. Gold coins are ideal, but any
  token at all will work.
  .
  It was a story as old as time. Four adventuring friends swaggered into a tavern.
  Sir Gillaboste clanked to the bar and shouted "Barkeep! An ale for my friend!"
  while Himbo the Thirsty unholstered his trusty lute.
  .
  The round and bald barkeep poured what passed as ale into four dirty glasses
  while keeping an eye on Shadow, who kept slipping her hands towards the purses
  of the honest customers. "What brings you back to our fine village?"
  .
  Grassy the White waggled their fingers, summoning a translucent hand to fetch
  their drink to a table in the corner.
  .
  "It's like this," Gillaboste said. "We were minding our own business, guarding
  this caravan of antique sculptures when...."
  .
  "Wait!" cried the buxom serving woman. "I heard it was a wagon of untaxed
  whiskey."
  .
  "So it was. Anyway, as we entered the Darkenscairee Wood, we were beset by
  bandits and..."
  .
  "Hold up," the mayor walked into the room, twirling his mustache. "I have it on
  good authority that you were accosted by demons."
  .
  "Right you are!" cried Gillaboste. "But they were wearing masks. Clearly bandits
  in training. And they had taken a princess hostage."
  .
  "And by princess," asked the stableboy. "You mean the crown prince?"
  .
  "Well, yes, but there was a dragon..."
  .
  "Wasn't it two dragons?" asked the red-faced blacksmith.
  .
  "Son of a...who's telling this story? Just give me a drink."
  .
  "Son, you can't can't get mad at the rumor mill for beating you here."
  .
  So You're in a Tavern can be played as a standalone game or it can be used as a
  rumor mill for another game to weave tales of the players' exploits and
  influence how the world sees the party.
  .
  So You're in a Tavern is a hack This One Time, which, in turn, is a hack of I
  Went to Japan Once by James Lennox-Gordon and is partially inspired by The
  Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen. It uses the Dicier font by Speak

  A few words from the author Jan Van Houten
  .
  This project was born out of a French "Dungeons for Beginners" jam coupled to my
  need for simple but efficient game for my TTRPG club. Our sessions are 55
  minutes long, I regularly have 7/8 very enthusiastic and imaginative players at
  the table, so I had to adapt and develop reliable methods.
  .
  I warmly thank:
  .
  My partner, who had the good idea of offering me a graphic tablet, and shows
  exemplary patience when I have to choose between two images only three pixels
  apart;
  .
  People of Twitter and the cestpasdujdr Discord. In particular Cme Martin,
  Guillaume Jentey, and Martin Lefebvre for their in-depth review and advices;
  .
  My students and their over-enthusiastic reception of my goofy ideas.
  .
  One last word on fonts

  This is a journaling game about dealing with ADHD. At the end of every night you
  write a journal entry about a fictionalized version of yourself. They have
  attempted the same things you have throughout the day, but usually with very
  different results. Create stats for this new version of yourself and roll on
  modifier tables to see how different your day might have been.
  .
  While the designed version of the game and the bookmark character sheet are
  priced at $7, the plain text version of game will always be available for pay-
  what-you-want. There are also community copies of the designed version available
  if you are unable to. I highly encourage you to donate the money you would have
  spent on this game to organizations supporting ADHD and other neurodivergent
  issues. Might I recommend Different Brains?
  .
  Note:
  .
  This game is about trying to see our daily lives through others' experiences. As
  such, try to keep an open mind and be as caring for this "other you" as you can
  be. I also acknowledge that everyone's experiences are different and my
  experience with ADHD is not necessarily the experience of others. I have worked
  with others to help account for this and wish to be as inclusive as I can be
  with this game.
  .
  This game is also not meant to be a diagnostic or clinical tool of any sort. The
  designer of this game is not a medical or mental health professional. If you
  suspect you have ADHD or another condition, please consult your primary medical
  caregiver or a specialist.
  .
  Also of note
  .
  I am currently researching a supplement that would include optional modifiers.
  These will deal with subjects like the process of trying to balance a medication
  dose, the inclusion of comorbidities, and the effects a menstrual cycle has on a
  medications effectiveness. I wish to cover these topics with care and need more
  time to cover them, but rest assured they are being thought of. If there is is
  something you feel should be included in this supplement, please feel free to
  reach-out and let me know.
  .
  Lastly
  .
  If you try the game, I would love to hear about your experiences with it. If you
  tweet about it with #SoftFocuses. I will also add more community copies for each
  thread I see.

  Soldier of Fortune is a game of turn based combat for two players. In keeping
  with the theme, the stats for both characters and their abilities are simple
  default values in JSON files that players must fill out. But don't get
  overzealous! Characters and abilities are distributed randomly at the start of
  each game, meaning your overpowered creations could wind up in the hands of your
  opponent!
  .
  File Modification Guide
  .
  There are two types of files that you'll modify in order to make your units and
  abilities.
  .
  Unit Files
  .
  These are the files named char_[letter].json, and contain the properties that
  define the character units.
  .
  name: The character name to be displayed in game.
  .
  hp: The amount of health points the character has. When this value reaches zero,
  the character is defeated.
  .
  po: The power multiplier for physical attacks. The higher this value, the more
  damage this unit will deal when using physical attacks.
  .
  eo: The power multiplier for energy attacks. The higher this value, the more
  damage this unit will deal when using energy attacks.
  .
  pd: The defensive multiplier for physical attacks. The higher this value, the
  less damage this unit will take from physical attacks.
  .
  ed: The defensive multiplier for energy attacks. The higher this value, the less
  damage this unit will take from energy attacks.
  .
  sp: The amount of stamina the unit will begin a match with.
  .
  Ability Files
  .
  These are the files named ability_[letter].json, and contain the properties that
  define the abilities that will be distributed between the two units when you
  play a match.
  .
  name: The ability name to be displayed in game.
  .
  pow: The base amount of damage this ability will deal. Modified by the po/eo
  values of the attacking unit depending on the isEnergy variable in the ability.
  .
  isEnergy: If this value is set to 1, the ability is an energy attack. If it is
  set to 0, it is a physical attack. Units have independent attack and defense
  values for energy and physical attacks.
  .
  staminaCost: The amount of stamina the unit must have available in order to
  utilize this ability.

game: Solipstry (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/S/Solipstry (USA)/Solipstry (USA).json
developer: Alex Rinehart
publisher: Alex Rinehart
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Origins
  .
  Solipstry was originally created as an attempt to merge the best parts of D&D 4e
  (tactical combat, meaningful choices, a reasonable number of skills) with the
  best parts of D&D 3.5 (emphasis on roleplay, enough choices to matter, powerful
  abilities not restricted by class). Since then, it has shed its D&D roots and
  become a system of its own (You can still see these influences in some areas).
  .
  Mechanics
  .
  Solipstry does not have classes. It is a skill-based game, where every time you
  succeed in using a skill, you get better at using it. Because you can pick which
  skills to emphasize, you can make your own "class" by combining different sets
  of skills. You also have abilities, which cost points. How many points you have
  total is determined by one attribute, while their regen rate per turn is
  governed by another. No more having to judiciously manage your most powerful
  spells for the day!
  .
  For those that want a little more control, the Luck attribute allows you to re-
  roll dice, avoid fail-by-one scenarios, or just add a little more oomph to your
  damage when the time really matters.
  .
  Our damage system uses multipliers to maintain consistent averages, while
  emphasizing interesting effects. On a normal roll of 3d8, you have the most
  chance of getting around 14 points of damage, while 3 and 24 would be outliers.
  In Solipstry, we inverted those odds, so you are more likely to get an extremely
  high or low result, rather than consistently average.
  .
  Who is it for?
  .
  Solipstry is simple enough for beginners to grasp, but complex enough for
  veterans to wet their hands and stay entertained. Our goal was to give DMs the
  freedom and flexibility to create whatever world they want to make and tell
  their own stories. Solipstry can be played in ANY setting. We have mechanics
  that are flexible enough, without bogging you down with supplements and point-
  buy tales. Try it out!
  .
  For more information, see our 2016 Kickstarter.
  .
  Chronicle
  .
  The Chronicle is technically a collection of monsters, but it is in no way
  required to play. The Solipstry core book has everything you will ever need to
  play, including sample monsters and instructions on how to create your own. The
  Chronicle is mostly lore and descriptions about how you might bring various
  monsters to life in your own game world. It includes quotes from people who've
  fought bears, seen ghosts, and encountered stranger and more outlandish
  creatures, varying from Network Spikes seen while hacking, to reality-bending
  Errata, supervillains, and more. You can find it on this project, or listed
  separately.

developer: jeeyonshim
publisher: jeeyonshim
genre: Role Playing
description:
  "Games connect us. Sometimes this connection is to fellow players, and sometimes
  to new stories we get to experience for a few precious moments. But Jeeyon's
  games do more. Introspective, therapeutic, and physical, they focus on
  connecting us to the natural world, our bodies, and our inner thoughts. They're
  deeply personal and the connections they form have a permanence no other games
  do. In doing so, they're helping to define a brand new wave of game design that
  we're just beginning to experience."
  .
  - Hakan Seyalioglu, co-founder of Thorny Games and designer of Sign and Dialect
  .
  Solitaire is a collection of six games for you, the solitary player. Each game
  reflects the world within and without, whether you are contemplating two stages
  of your own transformation, a choice you must make by the water, delicately
  placing seeds within rich soil, or staring into the heart of a candle flame as
  you let memories from your previous life slide away.
  .
  A note on safety: All the games in Solitaire are meditative, introspective, and
  emotionally resonant. Read the text before you commit to play and check in with
  yourself before you dive in.
  .
  Note: An updated version of the game will be posted in late winter, 2021.
  Previous players who've purchased or downloaded the game will be able to access
  the updated version without additional charge.

developer: torch60

genre: Role Playing
description:
  "Soma, a world once united under the banner of a great ruler, eventually torn
  apart by its own people by their hatred and distrust for one another. Two great
  beings appeared to decide the fate of the world. In a great cataclysm, Soma and
  everything within it was divided into two, and two guardian spirits would watch
  over these new realms."
  .
  About the Game
  .
  Soma Spirits is a choice-driven Role-Playing Game in which players will face
  heavy dilemmas with a colorful cast of characters. Unlike many games of choice,
  the decisions you will make in the world of Soma are not so black and white, and
  characters will undergo different changes depending on how you wish to proceed.
  .
  The world of Soma is a land divided into two similar, but distinct versions of
  one another. At certain locations, you will be able to travel back and forth
  between the World of Joy and the World of Sorrow and find different inhabitants,
  monsters, and clues on how to proceed. How you decide to help the people you
  meet along your journey will determine which of the game's five outcomes Heart
  and Soul will find themselves in.
  .
  Features
  .
  Turn-based combat with shifting character roles: Depending on where you are,
  Heart and Soul's abilities change!
  .
  Flexible story paths: you will have multiple opportunities to change the story's
  outcome.
  .
  Dynamic music: As you shift between the two worlds, so will the music!
  .
  Fully original audio and visual assets.
  .
  Five different endings.
  .
  Three different difficulty levels; enjoy the story at your leisure on Easy, or
  take on ruthless challenges in Hero mode!
  .
  Release Note!
  .
  Soma Spirits: Rebalance was released in 2017 as an updated version of Soma
  Spirits and includes new modes, features, and content not found in the original
  freeware version. You can play the original version by choosing the download

  "What if knights didn't slay dragons and instead helped them with their
  emotional issues?"
  .
  That was the thought that spawned Songbirds, and it aims to carry forward the
  idea of combating those intangible things that we struggle with on a daily
  basis. I know I've wanted to punch my anxiety in the face on numerous occasions.
  Well, now we can. Together.
  .
  This game has:
  .
  32 unique classes that you won't find in other games
  .
  Choose a genre to show your characters aesthetic
  .
  Hearts that you can trade to form bonds and relationships
  .
  Stress mechanics that take over for health/damage
  .
  And a basic contest system that uses ALL dice in a standard dice set
  .
  Not to mention that the book is 100 pages (50-odd spreads), and the ENTIRE back
  half of the book is dedicated to giving you tools to run the game! It includes
  .
  Principles and Tips
  .
  Methods for creating villages
  .
  NPC generation with the unique "Three Things" system
  .
  Creating adventures using songs
  .
  and a simple Opponent generation system that allows you to focus on language
  over crunch
  .
  This is a game for fans of classic anime, cartoons, action, adventure, and all
  flavors of heroics. You will make an entire unique character every single time
  you start a campaign, and explore personal areas that are meant to challenge
  your character specifically.
  .

  "This is breathtaking work! I just read the whole thing cover to cover. This
  game is basically Ghibli / Dianna Wynne Jones meets Nobilis; I can definitely
  see people in my circle showing up to give this a try at least for a one-shot."

game: Songs of the Northlanders (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/S/Songs of the Northlanders (USA)/Songs of the Northlanders (USA).json
developer: WolfWyzard
publisher: WolfWyzard
genre: Adventure;Role Playing;Strategy;Survival
description:
  The world around us has fallen. Ancient ruins, reminders of a past that no one
  remembers, dot the fractured landscape. Civilization clings to survival with
  shaking claws, as the chaotic wild encroaches upon it. Civilization creates a
  foothold, a light in the darkness. But every time the light is snuffed out and
  darkness crawls forth again from the depths and pushes back civilization. So it
  has been for as long as anyone can remember.
  .
  What is Songs of the Northlanders?
  .
  This game is a nod to games that came before it; the classics, the fantasy
  heartbreakers, the retro-clones, the indie revolution. This is all of that.
  Songs of the Northlanders is an OSR adjacent game compatible with monsters from
  B/X. It requires at least 3 players to play. It's best with 5, maybe 6.
  .
  Most of the players in this game take on the roles of characters who venture out
  on dangerous quests seeking gold and glory. It's about fighting monsters and
  getting loot. It's about trying to make it out alive. One of the players takes
  on the role of the Game Master (GM) who adjudicates the rules and is in charge
  of the overall pacing.
  .
  This is a roleplaying game. A game that will require imagination and thought. It
  requires that players invest in learning the rules, and interact with creative
  input.  It's a hard game where the rules are meant to be used and taken
  advantage of. Darkness creeps up and with every invocation tries to snuff out
  the light that surrounds your characters. You'll need to take your time and
  learn to master the system to fight back against that darkness.
  .
  This is a game about exploration and strategy. It is a game of social graces and
  violent deadly combat. Gather your friends and light your torches.
  .
  Intentions
  .
  I want to share this game with the world. I've put more than a year's worth of
  work into it -albeit off and on again. And this thing is going to drive me crazy
  unless I start putting it into the hands of others. That's you!
  .
  This is a ALPHA of the current revision of the game. And it's not complete yet!
  It has several missing parts that I intend to add over the next few days, weeks,
  and months. Until it resembles complete. BUT it is ready for you to play!
  There's enough here for a level one campaign.
  .
  What all is included?
  .
  This is an exploratory draft. The layout is minimal. The art is public domain or
  some licensed art I had laying around that didn't make it into a previous game.
  I hope this can be used to gauge people's interest in the game. I would LOVE to
  talk to you about this. I've set up a forum below. If you have questions,
  errata, or suggestions - let's talk.
  .
  So, what's included: 13 chapters featuring 65+ pages of content.
  .
  An Introduction and Character Creation
  .
  Abilities, Measures & Saves
  .
  Skills
  .
  Traits
  .
  Venturing Forth
  .
  Exploration
  .
  Combat
  .
  Magic & Spells
  .
  Ritual & Prayer
  .
  Camp
  .
  Advancement
  .
  Inventory & Gear
  .
  Sailing the Whale-Road
  .
  The play aides included are:
  .
  Two-page physical Character Sheet for at-home printing
  .
  A digital google sheets Character Sheet for online play.
  .
  What is Missing?
  .
  Quite a lot really. Songs of the Northlanders is missing
  .
  Seasons
  .
  Town
  .
  Conditions & Recovery
  .
  and more...
  .
  What's the Price for?
  .
  The $3.99 tells me you're interested in becoming part of the playtest. You get
  all the chapters listed above and all additional chapters as they release over
  the next few weeks and months.
  .
  You also get a PDF copy of the final game once it's released!
  .
  This early intro price is now only. The final PDF will NOT be $2. And as more
  chapters release the price will increase as well.
  .
  Format
  .
  Each chapter is uploaded as an individual file. This way if you wish to share
  the character creation file with your players you can. Or if one player is
  playing a magic-user you can share that file with them. Or if you're not playing
  with the magic-user, you don't have to worry about downloading or printing that
  chapter.
  .
  Also, this will make it easier as I make corrections to update the individual
  chapters quicker, without having to wade through the entire game.
  .
  I can't wait to play and discuss this game with you.
  .

  .
  The beloved Flash RPG series played by millions lives again in an all-new

  dead without his memories, he finds himself caught between the conflict of a

  force. With the help of some unlikely allies, he will discover his destiny is
  greater than he expected, and maybe save the world.
  .
  Sonny is a challenging turn-based, combat-focused RPG where unlocking and
  combining the effects of new skills and abilities is required to topple foes
  with an enormous amount of power. Sonny is designed for cunning and creativity
  with an emphasis on strategy and difficulty as the gameplay evolves. Featuring
  stunning artwork by Jet Kimchrea and an engrossing original score by David Orr.
  .
  Engaging, mysterious storyline full of secrets, conspiracies, and zombies.
  .
  Combat-focused gameplay with an intuitive interface.
  .
  Battles with an emphasis on strategy... think your way through it, don't grind.

developer: Undead Avian Publishing
publisher: Undead Avian Publishing
genre: Role Playing
description:
  When Sorbetta loses almost everything in a game of Blackjack, she realizes she
  has a serious gambling problem. Thankfully she was able to get help for her
  gambling addiction and also borrow what she needed to pay off her debts from her
  cousin. However, was this loan divine providence, or a deal with the devil? Join
  Sorbetta as she tries to not only earn the money (plus interest) to pay back her
  cousin, but also find four fantastical treasures that will ensure Sorbetta is
  never bothered by Sherberta again.
  .
  It's not as if the treasures are just garbage, and Sorbetta is probably wasting
  her time, right?
  .
  ...Right?!
  .
  Sorbetta
  .
  The protagonist of this lovely story. A necromancer by trade, she practices when
  she is able using all manner of bodies, both human and otherwise, to hone her
  skills. Unfortunately, she developed a fondness for Blackjack. A big fondness.
  Some bad decisions and a couple thousand gold later, she is now trying her best
  to pay off her over-bearing and bossy cousin.
  .
  Sherberta
  .
  Also a necromancer, like her cousin, however she specializes more with
  incorporeal beings rather than flesh and blood bodies. Self-serving, and ever
  the opportunist, she saw a perfect chance to profit off her cousin's
  little...problem. Even though she can be quite demanding and even a bit bullish,
  there does beat a heart of gold somewhere in that blue bombshell. Or, more
  likely, a heart that beats for gold.
  .
  When it comes to the color of their skin and the outlandish attire they both
  love to wear, neither woman is forthcoming with an explanation. Perhaps some
  things are best left unexplained?
  .
  Key-Anu
  .
  Not much is known about Sorbetta's business associate. The piano mimic spends
  his days in the basement bar, The Dusty Femur, longing for the day he'll get
  brought up to the first floor. Maybe he's just lonesome?
  .
  Raise the dead for fun and profit!
  .
  Multiple (2) endings
  .
  Original comedic script that isn't another JRPG parody or satire
  .
  Several members of the RPG Maker dev community have cameos. See if you can spot
  them all!
  .
  Most of the game development was done live on HawkZombie's Twitch.tv channel
  .
  Made almost entirely from RTP assets, for better or worse!

  This app adds responsive audio feedback to your keystrokes, for a better typing
  experience.
  .
  Choose from 20 different sets of sounds to make your keystrokes have the desired
  audio/emotional impact, including:
  .
  Typewriter/mechanical keyboard sounds for a crisper, more responsive typing
  experience
  .
  Applause or clapping sounds as you type, for motivation and support
  .
  Monstrous growling keystroke sounds to help you express your rage
  .
  Cute squeaking sounds to make you smile
  .
  Melodic or dissonant keystrokes on Marimbas, Vibraphones, or Grand Piano to give
  your typing some atmosphere
  .
  Gory blood-splatter sounds for typing/coding up a massacre
  .
  Firework sounds for celebratory typing
  .
  Burping keystrokes, obviously a core requirement of any typing program
  .
  The app minimizes to the system tray (lower right part of your screen). Click
  the Sound Typist icon in the system tray to change sounds, adjust volume, or
  exit the app.
  .
  Bluetooth Headphone Lag: Most Bluetooth headphones/earbuds have latency/lag that
  may make the keystroke sounds feel less responsive. Depending on your
  sensitivity, this may or may not matter. Recommendation: use wired speakers,
  wired headphones, or low latency bluetooth headphones (with apt-x low latency,
  or "gaming mode").
  .
  Installation Note: You may need to right-click the setup.exe and use the "Run as
  Administrator" option to install. If you are still having issues, try changing
  the "Reputation-based protection" settings in Windows to turn off "Check apps
  and files" and "Potentially unwanted app blocking". This is a random file off
  the internet after all.
  .
  Portable Version: You can now download the portable version that doesn't use an
  installer. Run SoundTypist.exe to start Sound Typist. You can minimize the
  window to the system tray. Keep in mind that if you use the "Start at login"
  option, then it will not work if you move the folder's location.
  .
  Those who are interested in adding their own sounds can search the comments for
  tips on how to do it yourself by modifying the configuration file. It is a
  completely unsupported and undocumented feature, so do not expect me to answer
  any further questions about it.

genre: Adventure;Visual Novel
description:
  The Space Between by Christoph Frey is a surreal short narrative experience in
  three acts about the walls we build for us.
  .
  The architect Martin Melanson, commissioned to build a theater, meets a woman
  named Clara, outside of his apartment complex at night. Attracted to each other,
  they visit the theater's building site.
  .
  While they explore the unfinished stage, surrounded by scaffolds and lost in
  thoughts, reality slowly fades, where the curtain opens and a dark play about
  closeness and separation begins.
  .
  The game's drawn-out, static nature, embedded in blurred PS1 visuals, supports
  its surreal plot and dialogues to create a dreamlike 40 - 50 minute experience,
  that should be played in one sitting.
  .
  Controls:
  .
  W,A,S,D to move
  .
  Mouse to look
  .
  E to interact
  .
  "Overall, these stylistic choices come together in a thoroughly cohesive
  aesthetic whole, amplifying cinematic qualities similar to those of an Ingmar
  Bergman or Nicolas Winding Refn film." RE:BIND
  .
  "The Space Between is deliriously uneasy in its final moments, thanks, in large
  part, to a skin-crawlingly stellar score." Wireframe
  .
  "The Space Between's Martin is afraid of intimacy, which is a lot like being
  terrified of death. Fearing intimacy is almost always about fearing loss." Wired
  .
  There is an excellent three part dissection of The Space Betwee written by
  @cathroon for RE:BIND, which I highly recommend you to read AFTER playing it.

  HISTORY

  I wanted to take a quick break from developing Kingdom Bash, and wanted it to as

  history! Space Duet is inspired by Spacewar!, one of the first video games,
  created in 1962. This is my take on it!

genre: Action
description:
  - Space Mayhem is an addicting little arcade shooter that's great for eating
  away your boredom. Climb the leaderboards as you collect money, powerups, and
  unlock new ships. Inspired by classic and modern arcade games, it's easy to pick
  up and play but will reward you if you put in the time and learn the game. It
  features numerous powerups to use, enemies to blow up, and ships to fly.
  .
  - GLOBAL LEADERBOARDS - Increase your score multiplier by defeating enemies.
  Keep it by avoiding damage. Keep that up and you'll be able to impress your
  friends and colleagues with your massive high score on the global Steam
  leaderboards!
  .
  - INFINITE WAVES OF ENEMIES - Battle against an ever increasing horde of unique
  enemies! From small Drillers, to battleships who will send Miners to blow you
  up. Watch out for the asteroids too!
  .
  - POWERUPS AND WEAPONS - Use powerups such as shotguns, shields, the roundhouse,
  the firehose and many more in order to survive a bit longer. Be careful,
  however, ammo is limited for powerups and your main weapon runs the chance of
  overheating.
  .
  - FLY UNIQUE SHIPS - When you blow up an enemy, they may drop a coin for you to
  collect. Use it to buy yourself a new ship. Each one has unique stats which will
  require different play styles as well as coming with its' own leaderboard!
  .
  Final Note from the Developer
  .
  Thanks for taking the time to check out Space Mayhem! It's been a blast to make
  these past couple years and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do. If you'd
  like to contribute to further development or you're just looking to chat, I'd
  love to hear from you on Twitter or in the discussions tab!

description:
  Ireland, 1942. Spare the Rod, Spoil the Child takes place in a Magdalene Asylum,
  a home for "fallen women" maintained by the catholic order of the Sisters of
  Mercy. To repent for their sins, the penitents have to work in a laundry without
  being paid.
  .
  In truth, the reality is horrendous. These women are humiliated, harassed, and
  famished. They are not allowed to talk and they cannot keep any belonging. If
  they disobey, they are beaten up. They may stay forever in this dreadful place,
  be sent in a mental institution, become a nun, or die alone.
  .
  The PCs will play these women. Will they be able to escape? Will they lose hope?
  Will they die of sickness or because of the beatings? Will they help each other
  or will they find it easier to act selfishly? Is there more to the asylum than
  meets the eye?
  .
  Spare the Rod, Spoil the Child is intended for any RPG but was created with
  Monsterhearts (by Avery Alder) and Bluebeard's Bride (by Beltran, Kelly and
  Richardson) in mind.
  .
  CONTENT WARNING: abuse, neglect, and death as thematic elements. Please use

  About
  .
  Spa Taxi ("Spa" is the German word for "fun") is a remake/clone of the original
  Space Taxi, where you need to bring passengers from one pad to another in mostly
  weird unnatural environments.
  .
  The gameplay
  .
  The 40 levels of Spa Taxi offer a variation of challenges:
  .
  Quick reactions
  .
  Avoid rockets and lasers or pass through moving gaps.
  .
  Puzzles
  .
  Push the right buttons, find the shortest path or utilize teleporters.
  .
  Learning
  .
  Memorize the passengers and their destinations, find out better (and quicker)
  ways to move, land or get your customers into or out of your car.
  .
  Dexterity
  .
  Use the right amount of thrust to be fast, but not crash into stuff and quickly
  know which thruster to use while flying upside down in veteran mode.
  .
  Requirements
  .
  Spa Taxi can be played with the keyboard, but is best played with a controller
  (currently only the XBox controller is supported, but others will follow).
  .
  It is looking best in a 16:9ish resolution at FullHD or above, preferring a
  multiple of it (e.g. 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 3840x2160).
  .
  Please check out the demo for Mac and Linux before buying to see if it runs on
  your machine, thank you!
  .
  Play the demo!
  .
  The demo contains 6 levels (plus tutorial) and is a great way to check out the
  gameplay, controller support and performance on your machine.
  .
  It also has a separate highscore list, so you can even compete with your friends
  here. :)
  .
  New and old
  .
  This version of the game takes the original concept and adds or changes a lot of
  things to get a whole new experience while retaining some of the retro feeling.
  .
  Rotation
  .
  The taxi can now rotate to get through narrow passages, avoid obstacles or even
  land on the ceiling.
  .
  Different types of passengers
  .
  There are those that fancy to loop the loop and go fast, but there are also
  those who will reveal their last meal if you rotate too much.
  .
  Health instead of lifes
  .
  The car has health (or integrity) and you can repair it while parking at a
  repair station (which costs money) or by having a mechanic on board.
  .
  When there is nothing left to repair, you  can buy a new car if you have enough
  money.

  solving a murder is your idea of a good time. Or robbing a bank. Ghosts are into
  all sorts of things

  you're really committed

  Somewhere in the vast multiverse, there is a post office box. It looks like all
  post office boxes in all parts of every world, and sits on the corner of any--or
  possibly every--street. Inside are many levels, inhabited by small spirits whose
  sole tasks are to ensure that the tiny pieces of every metaphorical puzzle
  arrive where they are needed before someone needs them. You are one of these
  spirits. Perhaps someday, you will rise to become a deity.
  .
  In The Spirit of Small Gifts, as you talk to your friends about the TTRPG games
  they're playing, you get to be the answer to the question "Is it reasonable that
  I'd have _____ in my inventory?" A Spirit of Small Gifts drops small, seemingly
  valueless trinkets in the mail so that the recipient has them in their pockets
  when they need them.
  .
  ----
  .
  Up front, the goals of this game are these: To get people talking to their
  friends about their RPGs, foster some creative problem solving, and give you an
  excuse to put some letters in the mail. The goal of this game is explicitly not
  to override, pressure, or force anyone running a game playing along with your

  Things can change.

  You just have to stand up and fight for it.
  .
  The Game.
  .
  Stand Up is a Belonging Outside Belonging game about rebellion, forming bonds,
  fighting injustice, and changing the world.
  .
  Take on the roles of normal people with the capability to become heroes, explore
  a fantastical world that houses mankind's inner feelings, and find a way to
  fight back using power only you can wield.
  .
  Materials.
  .
  3-7 players
  .
  a pool of tokens (coins, dice, poker chips, etc.)
  .
  something to write with
  .
  a printout of the playkit (a map, 7 playbooks, 4 setting elements)
  .
  Inspiration.
  .
  Stand Up is inspired by the Persona series of games by Atlus.
  .
  The games hold a special place in my heart not only for their amazing stories
  and characters, but also for the themes of rebellion, acceptance, and fighting
  for what you believe in.  This game is my love letter to those themes and
  Persona as a whole.
  .
  However, you don't need to know anything about Persona to play Stand Up.  The
  game includes explanations of the basic setting and premise, but players are
  free and encouraged to bring their own interpretations of the world of Stand Up
  into their sessions.
  .
  Playbooks.
  .
  Each playbook is based on a different archetype shown in the games, helpfully
  symbolized by cards in the Major Arcana.  There are seven playbooks, each with
  their  own focus and themes.
  .
  The Fool focuses on reaching out a helping hand.
  .
  Based on the Persona protagonists.
  .
  The Magician focuses on inspiring change in the world.
  .
  Based on Morgana, Yosuke Hanamura, and Junpei Iori.
  .
  The Chariot focuses on never compromising their beliefs.
  .
  Based on Ryuji Sakamoto and Chie Satonaka.
  .
  The Lovers focuses on making others stronger through support.
  .
  Based on Ann Takamaki, Rise Kujikawa, and Yukari Takeba.
  .
  The Emperor focuses on learning and teaching acceptance.
  .
  Based on Yusuke Kitagawa,  Kanji Tatsumi, and Akihiko Sanada.
  .
  The Priestess focuses on breaking free of expectations.
  .
  Based on Makoto Niijima, Yukiko Amagi, and Fuuka Yamagishi.
  .
  The Empress focuses on standing tall despite hardship.
  .
  Based on Haru Okumura and Mitsuru Kirijo.
  .
  Content Warnings.
  .
  Embedded: systemic violence and abuse of power
  .
  Potential: physical and psychological violence, abuse, exploitation and
  manipulation, etc.
  .
  Info.
  .
  This is Version 1.0 of Stand Up.  Whenever Stand Up is updated with a new
  version, you will automatically gain access to that new version free of charge,
  even if the price changes on this page.
  .
  Each copy comes with a 16 page PDF which includes the guidelines on how to play,
  a page to map out The Reversal, seven unique playbooks, and four setting
  elements.  You will also receive a playkit that includes the map, playbooks, and
  setting elements in printable black-and-white.
  .
  Community copies are included below.  If there are no community copies and you
  are unable to budget for a copy of Stand Up, feel free to reach out to me on

genre: Role Playing
description:
  The necromancer shrieks with cruel laughter, plunging the glowing dagger into
  the warrior's heart. Armor and bone tear like paper before the might of The
  Cursed Dagger of Ag'tekk. As the blood drains from the wound, Taft gloats,
  "Fool! All your struggle was for naught. Your soul will be but a tasty morsel
  for my dark master!"
  .
  He starts to pull the dagger out, but finds his wrist stopped cold by
  Francesca's iron grip. She stares back with an icy glare. Taft stammers,
  "I-Impossible! I caught you right in the heart!" A glint of light catches the
  necromancer's eye, and he looks down to see the talisman of protection. "But
  that means..."
  .
  Wresting the dagger from the necromancer's cold hands, Francesca grins. "That's
  right-I hid all my vital organs in a pocket dimension!" Taking a free hand to
  dip a finger in what appeared to be blood, she tastes it and chortles. "You
  wasted the ichor of Ag'tekk on nothing more than a large ketchup packet!"

  TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT: Be sure to give it a try before you buy it. We want
  you to enjoy the game but only if you're sure that STARDROP is your kind of
  game.
  .
  STARDROP is a single-player first-person video game where you take on the role
  of a Salvage & Rescue Operative named Aryn Vance. With her partner, John
  Kindley, at her side, the two embark on a journey full of mystery and suspense
  with some laughs along the way. STARDROP tells a genuine heart-felt story about
  a long lost starship, its crew and one individual in particular.
  .
  STARDROP presents its narrative through traditional cut scenes and in-game
  cinematic story telling as you play. The main campaign is where the heart of the
  game's narrative lies but you will also be able to experience the universe of
  STARDROP through its side missions.
  .
  Exploration lies at the game's core but so does accessibility. While the game
  offers puzzles and asks the player to figure out what to do or where to go next,
  the flow of information within the game will always guide you. Objectives are
  always made clear and designed with logic in mind. However, those who venture
  off the beaten path will find that there are more than enough secrets to be
  discovered.
  .
  Throughout the game the player will be able to interact with various types of
  interfaces such as control panels, elevators and security systems as well as
  other various interactive objects such as computer interfaces where you can read
  emails, listen to audio logs and more.
  .
  Your All-Purpose-Design (APD) space suit is equipped with a set of tools that
  you will need in order to succeed. The suit comes with a built-in flashlight.
  The object scanner enables you to identify objects of interest that you can
  interact with and it's also capable of zero gravity mobility under certain
  circumstances.
  .
  The DataPad is an essential tool. It enables you to view your current objective,
  read audio and text logs that you've collected and it also comes with a built-in
  mini-map.
  .
  Our main focus will always be on the game's story but we strife to deliver
  breathtaking visuals where possible. Our efforts have lead us to win Best 3D
  Graphics in the Intel Level Up Contest of 2017. We will continue to uphold these
  standards if not lifting them up even higher.
  .
  Four full fledged chapters that concludes the main game's narrative.
  .
  An engaging story enthralled by a captivating mystery.
  .
  Explore multiple spacecraft, Outposts, Stations and more as a salvage & rescue
  operative.
  .
  A small but diverse cast of characters brought to life by incredible voice
  talents.

  Starlight Shores launched on October 30th, 2020!
  .
  The Story:
  .
  After your childhood friend Theo wins a weekend getaway to the town of Seaside,
  you prepare to spend your birthday in paradise. It's been months since you last
  saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.
  .
  She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation
  to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just
  the get-together that you need to reconnect.
  .
  Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on
  driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's
  ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing
  along an uninvited guest.
  .
  Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's
  about the only thing you share in common...
  .
  Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?
  .
  The Cast:
  .
  Theo
  .
  Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a
  great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to
  have a tight-knit group and doesn't open up to just anyone. She studies
  photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time
  with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is
  your host for the weekend.
  .
  Lena
  .
  Lena is Theo's roommate... and replacement best friend. You don't know much
  about her, or even what she's studying. From what you've seen on Friendex, Lena
  is a vibrant and outgoing person. She's always dyeing her hair different colours
  and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she
  enjoys hiking and playing piano.
  .
  Alec
  .
  Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both
  have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally,
  renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started
  dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining
  that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to
  the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been pissing you off.
  .
  Erika
  .
  A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don't remember
  much about her, or ever talking to her...

  their flashlight, and everyone only being able to text-chat with 2 other stars
  (and the facilitator). That seems like it would work well.
  .
  The Stars Whisper is a live action role-playing game (LARP) where participants
  play the stars in a constellation, shining for millennia in the night sky.
  Participants will discuss and contemplate philosophical questions, such as the
  nature of truth, the meaning of existence, or the definition of love with each
  other, as they light up the void of space.
  .
  The game is for 8-12 people and a facilitator. It requires a room where you can
  turn off or dim the lights, flashlights, and the ability to print character
  sheets for players. It takes about 90 minutes to 2 hours to complete. The
  booklet features all the information needed to play, including safety
  techniques, rules for the players, rules for the facilitator, and character
  sheets.
  .
  The game is designed to be quiet, subtle, still, and meditative, and may summon
  up feelings of joy, melancholy, connectedness, loneliness, and introspectiveness
  in players. It is for people interested in pondering philosophical questions,
  having a contemplative experience, exploring connections with others in a unique
  way, or who just think that being a star for an hour sounds kind of fun.
  .
  When you purchase the game, you get (a) a PDF of the game, (b) a printer
  friendly PDF of the game, and (c) the character sheets, included in both
  documents.

description:
  "Starseed Pilgrim is a game about tending a symphonic garden, exploring space,
  and embracing fate."
  .
  You are a gardener, tending to empty noise and empty space to fill them both
  with colour. You are a refugee, building your own world away from the spreading
  darkness. You are an explorer, discovering new places, new rules, and new
  fascinations. The universe is bigger than you know.
  .

  .
  I really don't like describing Starseed Pilgrim! But if I don't, I'm pretty much
  asking you to buy it based on... images, and that's worse. It's a game about
  discovery and learning, and eventually about mastery of a strange set of tools.
  It's been said, and echoed, that it's a game you have to experience for
  yourself.
  .
  I guess I believe that. :)

  You are all inhabitants of the city, and you have been living in false peace
  under the rule of the demon king. The last wall, which offered your city limited
  protection against the demon king's tyrannical rule, has now fallen. Citizens
  are left with two choices; do everything the tyrant demands, or resist. Will we
  rise victorious against the demon king, or will our resistance be futile? We
  play to find out.
  .
  This game is intended to create a quick but rich prologue for characters who
  revolt against the demon king in a fantasy setting. It is possible to use this
  game to create a setting and characters for your preferred game about enclosed
  spaces and giant lizards.
  .
  To play this game, we will need 1-2 hours, 2-4 players, a deck of playing cards,

developer: Dimitri, Dr.Givaca

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Stepping into the Oblivion is a dice-less and GM-full TTRPG about the reunion of
  a group of friends, the stories they remember around a great trip they made and
  the realization of time as an enemy of remembrance, and the fading of said
  memories. The game builds around a growing sequence of dominoes, each holding a
  relevant detail about the trip. What happens when the tiles stop fitting
  together, and none of your friends can help out?
  .
  Stepping into the Oblivion also comes with 2 different game modes, with slightly
  different rules and a very different feel. One of them is narrated in the
  present, as if the Travellers were adventuring now, and rounds are also faster,
  contributing to a more exciting pace. The other is narrated in the past tense,
  and every forgotten memory feels much heavier, as if something forgotten now,
  many many years later, cannot possibly be recovered.

  version, created in August 2021, for the RPGenesis jam, is available in

  [NEW UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENT! I have been working on a newer snazzier version of
  this game with 2 bonus maps and some updated mechanics! Please ensure you get
  the updated file.]
  .
  Stories to Astonish the World is a point-crawl TTRPG drawing inspiration from
  Chinese landscape painting and literary compilations of weird supernatural
  events that happen to hapless travelers.
  .
  In this game, you play a motley group of travelers on a journey through the
  valleys and mountains of the Great River region. Motives and backgrounds vary
  greatly amongst your crew, perhaps you are a member of the literati travelling
  to appreciate scenery and poetic sights, an outlaw out to fulfill their mission,
  or a political exile going off to find the best place to be a wise hermit.
  .
  Regardless, you are united in three key points - you have some destinations you
  need to visit along the Great River, you have prepared yourself for perils both
  supernatural and mundane, and you definitely cannot do this alone.
  .
  Pick your map and embark on a weird and hopefully wonderful road-or-boat-trip.

  A strange deck of playing cards.

  A stranger appearing from a sudden storm.
  .
  The sheltering doorway of a lonely manor.
  .
  Unliving dolls smiling emptily as they chase you down.
  .
  They just want you to join them. Forever.
  .
  String Tyrant is a survival horror game where you must look, think, hide, and if
  necessary, fight your way out of a mysterious mansion filled with monsters and
  traps.
  .
  If you're defeated by a monster or fall for a trap, you'll be ensnared by the
  manor's residents - and join them to hunt your former friends. At least you'll
  be a pretty doll.
  .
  The game has an active card-based combat system where you build combos using
  your magical cards. You can hear nearby enemies through doors and walls, can
  open and close doors to try to break line-of-sight, and must contend with traps
  that will tax your wits. You'll need to unlock the secrets of the manor to stand
  a real chance of escape.
  .
  A free demo is provided. Please ensure system compatibility with the demo before
  purchasing the full game.
  .
  The demo covers the first "phase" of the game, featuring one enemy types, three
  doll types, and two endings. The full game contains more enemy types, traps,
  environmental hazards, new equipment, and the rest of the game's story.
  .
  Version 1.07 (June 14th, 2020)
  .
  This version fixes several bugs and adds the HD art pack as a free downloadable
  to anyone who owns the game. The art pack contains some of the sketches used to
  make the game and some unused assets.
  .
  Version 1.03 (April 22nd, 2020)
  .
  The OSX build has been split into its own version for both the demo and full
  game.
  .
  The Linux build has been discontinued as it is not cross-compatible with any
  other Linux versions. Version 1.02a will remain available for download for any
  Linux users who happen to be running Mint.
  .
  If you are a Linux user and would like to play the game, a guide has been
  written here by friendly user Bicobus. The guide is slightly outdated - the
  engine repository is here. You will need to compile the game for your distro,
  but the process is relatively painless.
  .
  The OSX version was compiled on OSX 10.14.6 Mojave. As above, please contact the
  team if you wish to compile the engine on another version.

  Prisoner 134. You have been purchased for testing and are now the property of
  BioMass Labs. Knowing nothing of the place you have been brought to, your only
  option is to enter the maze and solve the puzzles in the experiment.
  .
  In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded,
  crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a
  result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue
  bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law
  enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply
  wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run
  prison systems took form.
  .
  Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is common place. A blind
  trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing every
  day people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive
  divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons
  and law enforcement companies thrive.
  .
  Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an
  auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal
  ramifications.
  .
  Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are
  being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is
  known about the details of the study.
  .
  You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for
  law enforcement to release you to the company.
  .
  The subject is a sci-fi horror puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic
  puzzle adventure games with horror elements.
  .
  You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various
  puzzles set out in the experiment and discover the reason behind the testing.
  .
  You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a
  bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for
  record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by
  euthanization.

  SUBWAY RUNNERS is a Forged in the Dark game of gig economy adventures designed
  from the ground up to be played online by folks who are responsibly practicing
  social isolation. It uses online tools to quickly create random characters,
  gigs, and adventure details so players can get the ball rolling quickly.
  .
  What's Cool About Subway Runners?
  .
  I'm thrilled you asked!
  .
  We Got Wild with Random Generators!
  .
  You can make a character by going to perchance.org/subwayrunners, get them a gig
  by going to perchance.org/subwayrunnersgig, and get all the details you need for
  their adventure by going to perchance.org/runsubwayrunners! You're basically
  already playing. Also, each page has a Print File button on the bottom to save
  your runner's promotions as a PDF for posterity of future adventures!
  .
  Forged in the Dark with a Twist!
  .
  Like other Forged in the Dark games, you leverage your actions to take risky
  actions, get stressed and catch traumas, and do fun stuff to get promotions.
  Unlike any other Forged in the Dark game we know of, your list of actions is
  totally different from your fellow runners! You never know the trauma you're
  gonna get, from "rude" to "romantic"! Both your experience triggers and your
  benefits for doing them change from runner to runner and game to game! And if
  you don't like the runner you got, another file is just a click away.
  .
  Designed with Social Isolation In Mind!
  .
  A lot of folks are staying home right now, and making good choices for their
  community by limiting their in-person contact with others. Subway Runners is
  designed to run easy-breezy over discord, zoom, roll20, or wherever you hang out
  with your chums online! Toss a shared whiteboard in there if you're feeling
  fancy, or take notes in a shared google doc. On top of all that, the rules
  reference PDF is great to help players new to the FitD system get started quick.
  .
  The PDF has bookmarks!
  .
  That's not very cool, but Dan was real excited about it so we thought we'd
  mention it here.

  Praise for Subway Runners

game: Sunset (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/S/Sunset (USA)/Sunset (USA).json
developer: Tale of Tales
publisher: Tale of Tales
genre: Adventure
description:
  It's 1972 and a military coup has rocked Anchuria, a small country in Latin
  America. As a result, you, Angela Burnes, US citizen, are trapped in the
  metropolitan capital of San Bavn. Your paradise has turned into a warzone. To
  make ends meet, you take up a job as a housekeeper. Every week, an hour before
  sunset, you clean the swanky bachelor pad of the wealthy Gabriel Ortega. You are
  given a number of tasks to do, but the temptation to go through his stuff is
  irresistible. And what is he up to? As you get to know your mysterious absent
  employer better, you are sucked into a rebellious plot against the notorious
  dictator who rules the country with an iron fist.
  .
  Sunset is a narrative-driven first-person exploration game that centers on the
  discovery of clues to a story that takes place as you play.
  .
  Sunset is in part inspired by action games set in a war-like context, like many
  first-person shooters. What life would be like for the NPCs in such games? How
  does it feel when war is the backdrop for your day-to-day life?
  .
  How the game is played
  .
  Sunset is divided into 44 play sessions that each take a fictional hour: until
  the sun sets. Each time you get a list of tasks that you are requested to do.
  But there is more to do in the apartment than just work. There are other
  activities, such as going through the owner's possessions in search of
  information, and interacting with his 1970s-era technological gadgets.
  .
  The Story of Sunset
  .
  Angela Burnes, is not an empty vessel. She has a personality of her own and you
  discover her thoughts while playing. As a US citizen at the end of the sixties,
  she is inspired by the Black Power and civil rights movements. In an effort to
  learn more about egality, she travels to the then socialist republic of
  Anchuria. During her visit, a US-backed military coup happens and she is
  disallowed from leaving the country. Her university degree is not recognized by
  the new regime and she is forced to work as a housekeeper to sustain herself.
  .
  Angela's younger brother, David, who had followed her to Anchuria ends up
  joining an underground resistance movement. And Angela must worry about what
  happens to him when the war begins in earnest.
  .
  Gabriel Ortega is a lover of the arts. Through his work as a curator he met
  Maria Luisa of the wealthy Veleta family. Thanks to the money from their
  families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup
  happened, theaters and museums were closed. The new government offered affluent
  citizens safety and positions of power. Gabriel's wife, and most of her family
  and their friends, were happy to accept but Gabriel refused. Rising tensions
  between the couple ultimately lead to a separation.
  .
  The story of Sunset begins when Gabriel Ortega moves into a new penthouse
  apartment in the capital city of San Bavn. It is in this apartment that Angela
  Burnes finds employment.
  .
  "Sunset uses the routine of labour to exquisite effect as a framework to tell a
  story about class and political revolution." - Simon Parkin, Eurogamer
  .
  "Sunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles
  not often explored in this medium." - Game Spot, Josiah Renaudin
  .
  "Sunset is a wonderfully atmospheric slow burner and a valuable addition to a
  medium where the predominant approach to conflict is to just give you a big old
  gun and invite you to get stuck in." - Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "The story is excellent and will draw you in, making you feel as if you truly
  are Angela Burnes." - Jessica Mock, Hardcore Gamer
  .
  "Rather than focus on the explicit violence of a military coup, Sunset centers
  on the emotional brutality of war." - Reid McCarter, Playboy Magazine

  .
  The north pole of the planet Saturn has a hexagonal storm cloud pattern with
  8,600 mile long sides, larger than the diameter of Earth.

  Super Rad Raygun Overview
  .
  It is the year 198X. Big hair is hot, and the war with the Soviets is colder
  than a refreshing glass of New Coke. RAD RAYGUN must travel the world fighting
  communist robots, and save the 1980s by shooting his way through the decade in a
  totally fresh, expanded version of the original XBLIG game.
  .
  SUPER RAD RAYGUN pits Rad against a whole new wave of deadly enemies and
  locations - from the Communist strongholds of the Far East to strategically
  insignificant islands off the South American coast. But chill out, because Rad
  has gnarly new weapons, upgrades, and a revamped gameplay engine to help him
  out.
  .
  Ultra sharp 144p resolution graphics and 4 unique shades of monochrome off-green
  bring Rad Raygun to life, as only 80s mobile technology can.
  .
  Super Rad Raygun is a nod to video games and pop culture of the 1980s and pokes
  fun at the politics of that era. It is a trip down memory lane for retro
  enthusiasts, while also incorporating modern systems and play mechanics familiar
  to today's gamer.
  .
  About
  .
  Super Rad Raygun is a follow-up to the Xbox Live Indie Game, Rad Raygun. Led by
  Ronald Reagan and Dr. Yokoi (Dr. Y), Rad Raygun must save the 1980s from
  communist robots! While the original Rad Raygun had only five levels and limited
  upgrades, Super Rad Raygun includes over twenty levels, 3 modes of play, a new
  upgrade system, and a limited-energy mechanic.
  .
  As a play portable gaming's limited battery life, Super Rad has a limited amount
  of energy to perform certain abilities, such as jumping, shooting, and dashing.
  When Rad depletes his energy, he must rest for a few seconds.
  .
  Throughout the game, Rad collects "bits" - these are a form a currency used to
  buy upgrades from Dr. Y. As Rad becomes more and more powerful, he consumes more
  and more energy, but thankfully Rad can upgrade his battery life (amount of
  energy) and his agility (time it takes to recover).
  .
  DRM-Free!
  .
  Thanks to itch.io, we're bringing you Super Rad Raygun DRM-free for the first
  time ever!  This build does not require Steam and does not feature Achievements
  or Leaderboards.

  About the Game:

  Superhuman Industrial and Immaterial, Incorporated is a game about being an

  Story
  .
  Embark on a journey through your last years of high school and beyond as you try
  to find success, love, and yourself.
  .
  Aya Mizuki is a pretty typical teenager - cynical, lazy, and doesn't know what
  she wants to do with her life. As she finds she has a passion for volleyball,
  your choices will help guide her to passion in her love life as well.
  .
  Things don't always end on a high note... but sometimes, that's just how life
  is.
  .
  Characters
  .
  Aya Mizuki is a quiet, but lazy girl. She's not very social, and tends to spend
  most of her time with her nose in a book. She spends some of her evenings
  warming the bench for the school's volleyball team, as having club activities
  always looks good on a college resume. After a tragic accident injures one of
  the team's star players, Aya is called upon to step in, and with her Grandpa's
  help, finds a passion for volleyball that extends past her senior year in high
  school as she pursues a career.
  .
  Nanami Ebihara is the volleyball team captain, and hates the fact that Aya isn't
  taking things seriously. Quiet, shy and unassuming, Nanami is far from a typical
  high school sports star, instead she dedicates her life to her craft.
  .
  Yuka Saito is one of the most popular girls in school, pretty and with a sharp
  sense of humour she's the life of the party, so to speak. She flirts with and
  befriends Aya, introducing her to the local bar scene.
  .
  Eri Toyama is one of Nanami's oldest friends, and joins the volleyball team
  after meeting Aya. She looks up to Aya as a big sister, and though she has a lot
  of problems in her home life, she's always optimistic, cheery and cute.
  .
  Yuichi Hiyama is the star of the school's soccer team and is tipped for great
  things in the future. Yuichi and Aya become fast friends over their shared love
  of beef bowls. However as tryout season approaches, Yuichi comes to Aya with an
  offer she may not be able to pass up...
  .
  Aya's grandpa Satoshi lives in the countryside and takes care of Aya in the
  summer. Satoshi had an oddball sense of humour, an equally oddball laugh and
  loves his family very much. Maybe it's all the tea he drinks. What Aya doesn't
  know is that he was once an athlete too.
  .
  Features
  .
  Over 25 wonderfully rendered CG's by the new CG artist from A Wild Catgirl
  Appears 2.0
  .
  Partial voice acting and a 100,000 word script featuring multiple routes.
  .
  A completely new soundtrack, different from the usual VN fare.

developer: Mammut RPG, Antonio Amato
publisher: Mammut RPG, Antonio Amato
genre: Role Playing
description:
  .
  The Sword and the Loves is a story game for 3-5 players to tell stories inspired
  by Arthurian legends.
  .
  Each player controls a major character in a storyline filled with virtues,
  beliefs, love, and desire. Players take turns driving a part of their
  character's story towards a point of destiny, while other players interact with
  and influence that story.
  .
  The Sword and the Loves has two famous parents: the chivalric romances written
  by Chretien de Troyes and Archipelago III by Matthijs Holter.
  .
  The general mood owes much to the works of the French poet, while the rules
  belong to Matthijs' game, though there are with some changes to make the game
  closer to the characteristics of chivalric literature. Furthermore, some rules
  would not have existed without Love in the Time of Sei by Matthijs Holter and
  Jason Morningstar.

  Sword's Edge is a streamlined role-playing game that allows you to simulate a

  NOTE: This system requires cooperation at the table and a shared goal of telling
  a great story. It is the premise of SEP systems that the game experience should
  be fun for everyone and no player should be made uncomfortable unless that is a
  part of the experience of which they were informed and to which they agree.
  Shared respect and consideration among all participants are key to achieving a
  satisfying and enjoyable game for everyone at the table. If you disagree, this
  system and SEP games more widely are not going to meet your expectations or

  Once upon a time
  .
  There was a prince on a mission to save a princess from the hands of a
  terrifying dragon.
  .
  This prince, however, wasn't very brave, so his father ordered a witch to
  enchant a sword.
  .
  This magical sword had a will of its own and was, unlike the prince, brave and
  wise.
  .
  Together they embarked on an adventure of a lifetime.
  .
  A fairytale with a twist!
  .
  You play as the sword of the prince. Everyone in the land thinks the prince is
  brave and adventurous, but in reality his magical sword is all that.
  .
  Use your mouse to help the knight go through dangerous environments.
  .
  Defeat enemies
  .
  Avoid spikes
  .
  Slay the dragon
  .
  Save the princess!
  .
  Don't like reading?
  .
  No worries. You write the story by playing it.
  .
  Ooh, and if you do let the prince die, we'll just tear out that page!
  .
  Controls
  .
  You only need your mouse!
  .
  You control the sword with your mouse by moving it around. The prince will
  follow the sword, unless he is scared. Which happens more often than not.
  Because the prince is afraid of a lot of things. His fears include spikes,
  birds, green blobs, moles, heights, first dates, germs, fire and of course
  dragons!
  .
  By holding the right mouse button near the prince you can drag him to safety
  while he shivvers in his armor. You can also spin and swing the sword with the
  left mouse button to hit enemies or deflect projectiles.
  .
  What can you expect from this game?

  * 2 hours of gameplay!

  Welcome to The Synth Convergence, a trilogy of missions for The Sprawl RPG built
  around a core theme - synthetic intelligence. Across the three mission teams
  will cross paths with prominent synths and be forced to confront the question of
  how far they will go for their Corporate paycheck in a society where inequality
  is rife and Corporations control every rung of the ladder.
  .
  In The Tannhauser Investment (available as a free demo) the team are brought in
  to negotiate the tricky process of a hostile Corporate takeover - all while
  evading the awareness of the synth consciousness built into the super-luxury
  hotel the target is holed up in.
  .
  The Infinitive Extraction takes the team to the beating heart of the
  entertainment districts as they seek to extract Infinitive Cascade, the hottest
  DJ on the circuits from an exploitative contract. But do your employers want
  them for their musical talents or the military codebase at the core of their
  personality matrix?
  .
  Finally in The Vanda-Weiss Demolition the past catches up with the team as they
  face off against The Evolved, an extremist fringe group dedicated to wiping out
  synths and returning humanity to the true path before they are toppled by their
  own creations.
  .
  Get in, do the job, get out. It's never that simple but if it was they wouldn't
  have hired professionals like you.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  When the visitors first came, they said they were coming in peace. When the
  first disappearances were reported, we didn't want to believe it. We were too
  blinded by their technology, their superior intellect, everything they could
  offer us.
  .
  When the inevitable attack came, it was quick, brutal and devastatingly
  effective. They knew all our weaknesses by then. All our defences were wiped out
  in seconds.
  .
  In the days that followed, in the shadows of the flames, we came together. We
  got organized, and now we are bringing the fight to them.
  .
  * * *
  .
  T-DEF is a GMless game that comes in two 8-page mini zines: the Tactical
  Handbook that contains the rules for character creation and taking actions; and
  the Operations Manual, that contains everything you need to create missions for
  your troopers.
  .
  The game is a homage to XCOM by way of Dark Fort and Mrk Borg.
  .
  The game comes in both screen readable PDF:s and one-page printable files that
  you can cut and fold to have physical booklets. Put this in your pocket, wallet
  or purse with a couple of dice and a pen, and you're always ready to go on a
  bug-hunt! Play alone or with friends, in between slots at cons, on the bus, or
  over beers at the pub (you know, after the pandemic is over).

  UPDATE: I have made a much more printer friendly version of this after having
  figured out how to get the right dimensions for standard playing cards on Canva.
  I didn't review the content, and some of the titles awkwardly collide with the
  subtitles, but at least it's way more useful to anyone who might want to print
  them off and proxy them over some playing cards or M:tG cards or whatever.
  .
  I'm also working on a full guide to writing a TTRPG, with checklists and
  everything. I want to release it separately from this, but I'm still trying to
  make it work well alongside it.  I wish I could give free keys to the people who
  have bought this, but unfortunately there isn't a way for me to do that.
  .
  ---
  .
  Here's a tool for designing and playtesting ttrpgs or other physical games. I
  made this to help myself update my old work, and hopefully it will help others.
  As far as I know, there aren't any decks made specifically for TTRPGs available
  elsewhere. I tried to make it applicable to card games and boardgames the best I
  could, but you may have to ignore a few points that don't apply.
  .
  If you're unfamiliar with design lenses, they are cards that help you to focus
  on an important topic across all aspects of the game without getting distracted
  by other things that need to be done. Each card contains a list of items to
  contemplate, most often phrased as questions to get you thinking. The goal is
  not to answer each question so much as it is to use them as a starting point to
  consider what might need to change. Game design is a massive domain, and each
  item on a card is approximately a whole twitter thread's worth of theory, so
  feel free to research a topic if you feel you could learn more about it.
  .
  There's no particular order you need to use them in, and my recommendation would
  be to take a break of at least an hour after using each card. If you're not
  working to a tight deadline, it can be easier to just pick a single card for the
  day and apply it to however many projects you're comfortable working on in a
  day.
  .
  ---
  .
  Pricing note: This design tool is now $20. It was sitting at 7000 downloads
  having only made $23, so I removed pay what you want.
  .
  ---
  .
  The "Crowdfunding" card is based largely on Riley Rethal's PUNCHGO! and Trinity
  Knot Studio's TKS Pre-Crowdfunding Checklist, which are both great resources
  from Ken Davidson's TTRPG Resource Jam.
  .
  This is a submission to TTRPG Resource Jam and Itch.io's Bundle for Racial
  Justice and Equality.

genre: Adventure
description:
  Tacoma is a narrative adventure set aboard a high-tech space station in the year
  2088. As you go about your mission, you'll explore every detail of how the
  station's crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping
  story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.
  .
  At the heart of Tacoma is the facility's digital surveillance system, which has
  captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew's life on the station. As
  you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You'll use your
  ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these
  complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing
  the multi-layered narrative as you explore.
  .
  Tacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that
  tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling
  players deeper into the narrative than ever before.
  .
  A Richly Layered Story Experience
  .
  Six crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships,
  experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what
  happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as
  an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced
  and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.
  .
  A Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System
  .
  In each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of
  crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine,
  and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes'
  chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to
  discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.
  .
  A Deeply Interactive Gameworld
  .
  Explore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers
  to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously
  exploring extensive records of the crew's digital communications and personal
  thoughts. Every facet of the crew's experience on Tacoma is part of your
  investigation.
  .
  A Vision of the Future
  .
  Experience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that
  depicts humanity's expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond. A deeply-imagined
  speculative vision of the near future from the award-winning story team behind
  Gone Home and BioShock 2: Minerva's Den.
  .
  A Compact Narrative Experience
  .
  Tacoma is estimated to take around 2 to 5 hours to complete. How deep you dig
  and how much detail you find is up to you. Tacoma is a non-combat, non-puzzle-
  focused game. The details of the story and gameworld are there for you to
  discover at your own pace.

description:
  A small village known as Windy Meadow may not be rich or famous, yet it offers
  something even more valuable: harmony. Gorgeous views, serenity of the forest,
  gentle rivers and fertile land... Even beasts and dragons seem to usually keep
  their distance.
  .
  Nevertheless, not everyone can find peace here. The time has come for three
  young people to decide what are they going to do with their future. And it's
  happening much sooner than they would wish for.
  .
  Will Vena, the best huntress in the village, stay with her family? Is it better
  to take the lucrative job offered by distant merchant guild?
  .
  Fabel wants to become a famous bard, but his rough past complicates so many
  things. Should he follow his dream, or is it finally time to wake up?
  .
  And is Iudicia, the local outsider and talented herbalist, going to marry a man
  she doesn't love? Is spending her future alone and lonely the only alternative?
  .
  Three intertwined stories. For 2,5 hours you get to play as three protagonists
  with their own problems to solve. Each route offers different moods, topics and
  perspectives and all of them share the dramatic, final chapter.
  .
  A multitude of side characters. Their varying personalities and complex
  relationships make this community feel alive and relatable.
  .
  An immersive, detailed village. You get to visit multiple buildings and outdoors
  and see how they change over the course of the game. The carefully thought-out
  fantasy setting reflects through both the dialogues and visuals.
  .
  Choices matter. Choice-shaped endings significantly shift the game's atmosphere,
  while even smaller decisions influence dialogues, events and how your
  protagonists are perceived by other characters.
  .
  Heart-warming scenes. A unique mix of coziness and melancholy supported by
  colorful pixel art and emotional music.
  .
  Animated visuals. Unlike most Visual Novels, Tales From Windy Meadow replaces
  the majority of narration with animated character sprites. More than 99% of the
  in-game text represents dialogues.

  Tales from the Road - Furry Interactive Fiction - Made in Twine
  .
  Tales from the Road is a slice of life interactive fiction game. The game
  features a story about a disgruntled freelance worker who has grown bored of
  their work. Seeking to do something different with their life, they come up with
  the idea to go on an excursion across the country.
  .
  The game is currently in development and still has some time to go until I would
  consider it "finished". Despite this, there's still a decent amount of content
  currently available. With total playtime hovering around 1-3 hours given the
  content that's in-game right now.
  .
  So, what is in the game?
  .
  Currently, the game has 4 fully completed chapters. With the first 3 chapters
  mainly laying the groundwork for the eventual excursion across the country. They
  introduce and develop the core cast of characters, while also providing a bit of
  backstory for the player character.
  .
  Chapter 4, the latest chapter to be completed, marks the actual start of the
  road trip. In which, the main cast of characters head to the first road trip
  stop, Chicago. With Sasha being the main focus of this chapter - most of your
  time will be spent exploring Chicago alongside her.
  .
  The next chapter, 5, is currently being worked on.
  .
  I'm planning for a total of 8 chapters, although chapter 4 and the proceeding
  chapters will be substantially longer than the first 3.
  .
  How is the game played?
  .
  The game is played in your standard Twine environment, which is to say it's
  mostly text-based. At the start, you'll be asked to make your character which
  involves picking a name and race (Wolf, Lion, Fox, or Dragon). From there on
  you'll be able to navigate the world, make choices, and go through dialogue by
  selecting certain inputs. See screenshots for examples.
  .
  Of the main cast of characters, 3 out of the 4 currently have artwork. This
  includes Sasha, Holly, and Valery. I do plan on getting art done for the 4th
  character, Jacob, at some point.
  .
  Speaking of, all artwork was done by the fantastic Kasscabel. Check out her
  Twitter page here or her Fiverr page here.
  .
  What kind of content is in the game?
  .
  This game is mostly safe for work. There is swearing and some things that could
  be considered suggestive. Nothing crazy though.
  .
  Boring stuff
  .
  If you encounter any bugs, feel free to let me know in the comments section.
  Even if you didn't have any problems, I'd appreciate hearing any feedback you
  might have!  Just post it on here via a rating (top right corner) or a comment.
  Helps let me know if I'm doing stuff right.
  .
  Tales from the Road will always be available for free on here. Donations are on
  for the standalone download if that's something you'd be interested in. Welcomed
  but not expected blah blah blah you know how it is.

  What is Talk To Me?
  .
  Talk To Me is a Western-style Visual Novel. It's a Dating Sim--kind of--but
  also, maybe you shouldn't play it like that.*

  through the day. After his mother dies, Ordell moves to a different town to
  start over, but things don't seem to be getting any better for him.

  Lusting for the latest? Check out Tallowmere 2: Curse of the Kittens.
  .
  Raise your shield. Embrace Lady Tallowmere's dungeons.
  .
  Indulge Lady Tallowmere. See how far through her lovingly violent dungeons you
  can delve in this 2D indie action roguelike-inspired platformer.
  .
  New rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to
  be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure
  chest you'll come across.
  .
  Each room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you
  go.
  .
  The concept is simple yet hard to master:
  .
  Raise your shield to block enemy attacks.
  .
  Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right.
  .
  Jump or move to avoid traps, or raise your shield to reduce damage taken.
  .
  Find the key to advance to the next room.
  .
  Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your
  journey.
  .
  Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive
  abilities.
  .
  Stay alive as long as you can.
  .
  Brace yourself with your shield as you learn the quirks of each foe and trap so
  you can strive for that "one more run" high-score victory! Each dungeon is
  infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; a local scoreboard
  lets you track your greatest efforts.
  .
  Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Play with keyboard (and
  optionally mouse), or use your favourite gamepad/controller.
  .
  Tallowmere offers single-player and local co-op madness (up to 4 players,
  desktop-only) for fun frantic couch gaming.
  .
  To those who will be lured into Lady Tallowmere's dungeons: good luck.

  Tarot Telling For Two
  .
  A downloadable game.
  .
  In this cooperative storytelling RPG, two players will each create a character
  and explore their characters' relationship with one another using Tarot cards
  and their associated meanings as prompts. Players may use a shared deck if
  playing in-person, their own decks if playing remotely, or online decks if
  that's the only kind accessible (or any deck for any reason!)
  .
  This game fits on a single tri-fold brochure, with an optional-to-print Sample
  Play in the same format. I've also included an unformatted text version, where
  the Sample Play is interwoven with the game directions, for increased
  accessibility.
  .
  In addition to enjoying an RPG that explores feelings and encourages creativity,
  Tarot Telling also gives players a chance to expand their own Tarot practices by
  interpreting how cards in different positions may affect different situations
  differently.
  .
  This game was developed for the Me, My Friend, And My RPG Game Jam.

  along the way. The player at the mouse controls Phulax, a guardian spirit
  protecting the temple's treasure from would-be thieves. He must prevent Indira
  from leaving the temple with the treasure, by shifting around the floor she
  walks on, matching three tiles of the same color to create traps for her.
  .
  Test your wits in three different chambers of the Temple:
  .
  Bridge - If Indira doesn't watch her step, Phulax could whisk away the ground
  beneath her feet, sending her plummeting to the forest below!
  .
  Courtyard - Huge spikes block Indira's path to the treasure. She must move
  quickly, or Phulax may use the spikes to destroy the treasure- or her!
  .
  Crypt - This chamber is full of giant boulders, and Phulax is ready to roll! Can
  Indira dodge all the rolling boulders, or will she be flattened before she can
  escape?

developer: ArcturusAsriv
publisher: ArcturusAsriv
genre: Card Game
description:
  The Temple of Karthis is a solo dungeon crawling game using cards and dice.
  .
  Each turn, the player will roll dice to generate the immediate layout of the
  dungeon and then draw cards to see what threats are present, if any.
  .
  If a threat is determined, the player will then roll a die to see how well he or
  she did in overcoming the obstacle.
  .
  However, treasures are also likely to appear instead of, or with, a threat.
  .
  The game is completed when the prized relic, the Jeweled Crown of Karthis, is
  found.
  .
  At which time, the explorer will add their collected treasures and note the
  dungeon level they completed the game on.
  .
  The game can be replayed as often as desired, with the player gaining a benefit
  for how far they have ventured in previous journeys.
  .
  As such, the game lends itself to a 'beat the high score' type of game, with the
  player attempting to reach a higher score with each play through.
  .
  (Cover art was created using pieces of public domain art.)
  .
  Update: Cards have been added to the files.
  .
  The 34 cards replace the playing cards.
  .
  Both the Spades and the Clubs suits are represented by Skulls to simplify things
  a bit.
  .
  The two crowns replace the Joker cards. You still need to collect both to find
  the Crown.
  .
  And there is only one enemy card, since you'll only ever use just one in a game.
  .
  This will also eliminate the extra step of randomly drawing an enemy card.
  .
  All art was taken from Public Domain images and edited extensively.
  .
  I hope the cards help give the game a bit more thematic flavor.
  .
  Update 2: I added separate image files for the Graph Sheets and the Tiles Chart.

  Manipulate the elements to turn the battlefield to your advantage, but beware

  Unearth ancient ruins, discover strange artefacts, and meet new friends, in a
  lush, painterly world. Explore the reaches of the archipelago by boat. Take to
  the skies as a bird to survey the landscape and plan the best route forward.
  .
  For a generation, the terrible Fog - one vast, voiceless, and cruel spirit - has
  been eating the once-thick forests of the mainland. Now, with nowhere left to
  call home, and granted magic by the friendly spirits of the archipelago, one
  small party of would-be adventurers sets out. Find a way to save the many goblin
  towns of the rocky coast, discover the truth of the Fog, and, if possible, put
  an end to it.

  A note on playtime: Tenderfoot Tactics has a nonlinear structure and much of the

  Here's what people have said about TENNNES:
  .
  It's almost as visually minimalistic as Pong, and it has very simple pick-up-
  and-play controls like Virtua Tennis, but it's tactically much deeper than
  either of those games. --Bennett Foddy
  .
  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gutefabrik/sp...
  .
  What TENNNES has managed, in its simple glory, is a distillation of both the
  instinctive brilliance of tennis and the longer metagame that occurs between
  opponents. -- Nick Dymond
  .
  http://forceofhab.it/blog/tennnes-anyone/
  .
  Instead of being just a refinement of its source material,Tennnes challenges our
  expectations of digital games by presenting a set of mechanics with few
  directions other than its puckish title. -- Charles Pratt

  TENNNES features a brilliant jingle and sound effects by Eirik Suhrke, whose

  You're really going to need 2 gamepads to play TENNNES. The game can be played
  by/against AI, but that's absolutely not the intended experience.

genre: Visual Novel
description:
  After finding the cursed play 'The King in Yellow', Trixie Glimmer Smith, a
  slacking student at Bluebell University recounts the terrible events that set
  her a week behind in her coursework.
  .
  This story follows on from the events of Parsnip (free download here) with a
  host of new characters and an expanded world, although you can still enjoy it
  without playing Parsnip.
  .
  Trixie is around 3-5 hours long, if you want to play all the content.
  .
  Check out the free demo below!
  .
  Features
  .
  Insight:
  .
  Throughout the game events may start to take their toll on Trixie's mind. As
  Trixie gains insight her narration becomes ever more unreliable.
  .
  Unlike many sanity systems Trixie's insight system is hidden, meaning you never
  know for sure when you are being affected by it.
  .
  This system also means additional playthroughs of the game may vary!
  .
  Can you really trust anything Trixie sees? Can you afford not to?
  .
  Multiple Paths:
  .
  Trixie can choose to spend her week with the Friendly, albeit slightly scary
  shopkeeper Heidi, the excitable baker Gregg or the chill milkwoman Bell.
  .
  At points the three routes may intertwine, giving different perspectives on the
  same story.
  .
  The game also has two main potential endings, with additional minor alternate
  endings.
  .
  A Strange World:
  .
  Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, psychic birds and cosmic gods, Trixie
  explores the rural England inspired Bluefields County and discovers some of the
  horrors that secretly lurk in it's scenic countryside.
  .
  Art Book:
  .
  If you spend $6.99 on Trixie you get an Art book with the game! Exciting stuff!
  It contains all sorts of concept art,  bios and fun trivia about the game, the
  characters and the world.
  .
  Content Warnings:
  .
  Trixie Glimmer Smith contains a few mild descriptions of violence, horror,
  implied sexual content, some exploration of negative trans feelings and some bad
  language.

game: Texture to SkyBox Converter (USA)

developer: mMcFab
publisher: mMcFab
genre: Utility
description:
  Convert flat horizontal tiled textures into convincing skyboxes! Useful for,
  well, skies! But also useful for reflection maps.
  .
  This is for those cases where you want more artistic control compared to a
  procedural skybox generator. It also works fairly well for panoramas.
  .
  Simply load a texture (Must be PNG right now) and choose a tile resolution,
  Top/Bottom Pixel amount and it will magically generate a somewhat convincing
  skybox! It will automatically preview and spin around the skybox to give you a
  good idea of the result. The preview uses the output resolution and is genuinely
  a cube so what you see is what you get.
  .
  Taller textures will look as though the vertical disappearing point is further
  away. Bigger textures will generally look better.
  .
  Controls
  .
  LOADING
  .
  <A> Prompts you to select the texture you wish to convert. Select a nice PNG
  from your filesystem. If the file is valid and readable by the program, it will
  ask you what square resolution you want for each side of the skybox (This is
  capped at 4096 and defaults to 512).
  .
  It will then ask for a "Top/Bottom Pixels". This effectively determines how many
  pixels will be put into the bottom and top caps of the skybox from your texture.
  It will have a suggested value by default which usually has a rather desirable
  amount of warping (0 will look a lot like a cyclinder with solid caps. Half your
  texture height or more will usually have slightly squashed horizons, 35% texture
  height is usually pretty good)
  .
  Cancelling these prompts will reprompt until you confirm with valid input.
  .
  SAVING
  .
  <S> Exports the map as an unfolded cube, with automaticically added bleeding at
  the edges. This works tested with Unity (Set "Texture Shape" to "Cube" and
  "Mapping" to "6 Frames Layout (Cubic Environment)" in the import settings) and
  GameMaker with a shader built to handle 2D skycubes.
  .
  An example of this texture (Generated from a square texturecomprised of gray and
  white squares with up and right arrows with 35% Top/Bottom pixels):
  .
  <Ctrl+S> exports each side individually, named by default to correspond with the
  6-sided Skybox shader (remember to set Wrap Mode to "Clamp" in the import
  settings!)
  .
  I made this in GameMaker for personal stuff and I haven't polished it up really.
  .
  If the tool garners enough interest, I'll probably make a v2 with more exposed
  settings (e.g, Stretch sliders to change how squash is calculated, texture
  filtering, realtime preview updates etc) and an improved UI.  Until there is
  demand for this, there's little point me expanding further as it does exactly
  what *I* need it to do.
  .
  If there's demand for it, I may compile a Mac version too
  .
  I have no idea how to setup a skybox in Unreal Engine to say if it works with
  it.
  .
  Compatibility:
  .
  Made for Windows 7 and up. Incompatible with XP. A DX11 compatible device is
  necessary.

  Idris is a bonds man- a special bonds man. While most of his clients need to
  bail loved ones out of jail, a few are looking for a reprieve from someone they
  once knew. For Evalise, all she wanted was to get a bail bond for her boyfriend,
  when Idris surprised her with a simple but confusing question.
  .
  What if you could make him forget all about you?
  .
  Evalise's boyfriend has a bit of a wild side... and a bit of a knack for being
  caught. She arrives at a bail bonds place run by a man named Idris- however,
  while working out a bail bond, he springs a question about a different kind of
  bond- a memory bond. With his knife, he's able to sever any ties a person has
  with someone else, permanently, making the other person completely forget about
  his client. With one small cut, she'd be able to leave her not-so-great
  boyfriend behind and move on...
  .
  That Which Binds Us (TWBU) is a josei otome visual novel centered around a young
  woman named Evalise. The full game is over 5 hours long and contains a new game+

developer: summitfever
publisher: summitfever
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  There Will Be Ink is a difficult tactical action game for 1-8 players. Play solo
  or with friends in battles between stick figure armies on a paper notepad, just
  like you used to draw in class instead of paying attention!
  .
  TWBI is a difficult game, where charging forward into the fray will rarely win a
  battle. Tactical thinking is essential. Assessing the battlefield, taking cover
  as needed, keeping an eye on troops positions: all of these are essential for
  winning the day. Or, if that sounds like a chore, switch to "Arcade Mode" and
  run & gun at will!
  .
  Tactical Depth
  .
  Although the theme and visuals might suggest otherwise, there is a lot of depth
  underlying these doodles. As units gain experience and level up during a battle,
  they become progressively more proficient at battle and will go prone to evade
  danger, hide behind cover when attacking, and dodge incoming rockets. Ranking up
  also increases various other attributes, such as stamina, ammo capacity, weapon
  accuracy, and even how quickly a unit will raise or lower a flag to take over a
  building. Actions such as running, rolling, and throwing grenades take stamina,
  and if a unit's stamina runs out they become exhausted and must wait a short
  period to catch their breath. Outside of battle, the player can use experience
  points earned during battle to unlock unit-specific and global training and
  weapon upgrades as well as HQ abilities like ammo drops, paratroopers, and air
  strikes.
  .
  Mission Variety
  .
  While some missions see you attack the enemy head on, others involve building up
  a base using engineers, rescuing prisoners behind enemy lines using a lone
  sniper, fighting against your own defecting forces, traditional "boss" fights,
  and even battling it out at sea (upcoming). In addition to the built-in campaign
  missions (39 and counting), There Will Be Ink includes a map editor to design
  your own battlefields from scrap as well as a campaign editor to string missions
  together into a full fledged campaign. Or, if you're not feeling creative, be
  sure to check out the "Quick Battle" option, which allows you to choose a few
  variables using sliders and toggles and then jump into a random map.
  .
  Persistent Battlefield
  .
  In There Will Be Ink, the history of any given battle is retained by the
  craters, shells, and red ink spilled on the battlefield, while end-of-battle
  stats are there to give you a more numerical analysis of the battle.
  .
  Play With Friends
  .
  Play with or against up to 7 friends in local multiplayer (or with a few friends
  online using Steam Remote Play Together). A team can play through a whole
  campaign together or just a quick battle or player-designed map. In campaign
  missions that were previously won, players can join the enemy team for an extra
  challenge (or not!). In addition to end-of-battle stats for players to compare,
  badges are presented to players for such feats as the most kills, longest
  streak, most deaths avenged, and many more (including less brag-worthy badges
  like most deaths and most medics killed).
  .
  Game Features:
  .
  Fast-paced action gameplay with a focus on cover
  .
  Take control of any friendly unit on the battlefield
  .
  Play through nearly 40 missions (and counting) across three campaigns
  .
  Jump into a quick battle with the random map generator, with sliders and toggles
  for troops & buildings, trees, debris, and rivers
  .
  Unlock new recruit types as you play, including rifle infantry, assault
  infantry, snipers, medics, RPG troops, heavy machine gunners, engineers, laser
  jetpack troops, and flamethrowers, why not!
  .
  Full featured map editor - lay out a battlefield and jump straight into the
  action
  .
  Campaign Editor - string missions together into a campaign to play with your
  friends
  .
  Enjoy hundreds of frames of (poorly but enthusiastically) hand-drawn art!
  .
  Join a battle in progress for 8 player local co-op or vs. gameplay
  .
  Navigate dynamic battlefields by wading across rivers and taking cover behind
  trees, rocks, sandbags, and craters left behind in the chaos
  .
  T-Rex with jetpacks!
  .
  Compensate for weather effects like rain, wind, and smoke rising from burning
  buildings and trees
  .
  Earn training credits, even when a battle is lost, to assign new abilities to
  your troops
  .
  Game Status:  The game is currently in development, so any constructive feedback
  is greatly appreciated. Purchasing the game grants you access to all future

publisher: Alex Rinehart
genre: Role Playing
description:
  There's a Wolf In Those Woods is an experimental murder mystery game. While
  finding out who killed the Woodsman is interesting, the real point of the game
  is to discover who the other characters are playing.
  .
  6 players will adopt the identity of an interested party and ask each other
  questions to determine who did the deed. But more than just finding out who
  killed the unfortunate Woodcutter, the players must also try to figure out who
  each other is.
  .
  If you've played similar "ask questions to deduce the murderer" games, you may
  have some expectations. These are likely wrong. For example, it's perfectly okay
  to ask "Did you kill the Woodsman?" Just know, you may not like the answer you
  get.
  .
  The 5 characters are:
  .
  The Woodcutter's Wife, Alenka
  .
  The Forest Witch, Maven
  .
  The Spirit of the Forest, Undergrowth
  .
  The Woodcutter's Assistant, Karl,
  .
  A literal Wolf
  .
  The Woodcutter is  played by a facilitator who is less active in gameplay.
  .
  This game is intended for adults and contains strong language and adult themes
  including MURDER.
  .
  Each of the characters have secrets, as well as means, motives, and opportunity.
  Additionally, many characters have "tells", subtle giveaways when they tell a
  lie. Observe each other and call out any lies you see!
  .
  This game does not feature dice or a gm, though a facilitator playing the
  woodkeeper is beneficial to minimize the risk of spoilers. The only thing you
  need to play is the book, the character sheets (these should be kept secret and
  ideally printed out) and the secret information pages contained within (these
  should also be kept secret and ideally printed out).

description:
  These Cards Have Hearts is a small tabletop role-playing game about card games
  and friendship. You will play as someone who cares way too much about a
  children's card game challenging a tournament that has a dark secret that could
  change the world. Fight against friends and rivals using your Heart, Skill,
  Luck, and Money. No matter who wins, the real winner is usually friendship.
  .
  To play all you need is 3-5 people, 4-6 hours, some 6-sided dice, and something
  to write things down with. You do not need any real cards to play this game!
  .
  If you grew up enjoying watching Yu-Gi-Oh (or Bakugan or any game-based
  friendship type of show) and thought it would be fun to be a cool anime
  character and have action-filled anime card battles where the rules, numbers,
  and cards really don't mean anything then I think you will really enjoy this
  game!
  .
  While I do consider this game a finished project there are plenty of things I
  would love to add to it and/or expand on. If you play this game and have any
  thoughts about it, please let me know how your time with it went. It will help
  me know better which things may need improvement and also hearing that people
  played my game would make me very happy!
  .
  These Cards Have Hearts is a Powered by the Apocalypse game and has mechanics
  inspired by The World Wide Wrestling RPG by Nathan D. Paoletta.
  .
  Special thanks to the people who helped play-test this game: @Gender_Pirate,
  @SunnyTranxiety, @disabledpaladin, and @DDemonEclipse. They are all wonderful
  people and helped me make this game into something I love.

  Ted and Molly are together. Ted feels a connection to Molly wherever he looks.

  But, how do they both really see the relationship? See each other?
  .
  "Thing-in-Itself" is an interactive short story about the struggles of
  understanding another human being. Using Immanuel Kant's concept as a framework,
  it leads the player through stages of a relationship, exploring how perceptions
  may clash and surroundings can alter.

  With an average walkthrough time of 15 minutes, "Thing-in-Itself" is not a game
  in a traditional sense - it doesn't have win or lose conditions and doesn't
  present challenge to the player.

  With this project, Party for Introverts attempts to establish a connection
  between the mediums of game and short story, reworking the possibilities when
  narrative and interactivity merge.

  You've been invited to a haunted house. That haunted house is a Discord server.
  .
  Find your greatest fear, spill your worst secrets, and get to the thrilling
  seance in This Discord Has Ghosts in It.
  .
  Players are either investigators or ghosts:
  .
  investigators can only speak
  .
  ghosts can only type
  .
  Won "Most Innovative" at the 2021 Indie Game Developer Network's Indie
  Groundbreakers
  .
  A Discord-based live-action roleplaying game
  .
  Players split into two teams: investigators and ghosts.
  .
  Ghosts may only type, filling the channels of a Discord with frights! Spreading
  horror throughout the rooms and spaces of this house with text, images, audio,
  or video.
  .
  Investigators may only speak in a voice channel, with everyone listening in,
  like walkie-talkies or shouts throughout the space.
  .
  Throughout the game, ghosts haunt rooms while investigators explore, get
  spooked, and learn about the ghosts, all while narrating the horror to all
  players and hinting at their secret motives. Ghost players reveal parts of
  themselves by creating new rooms, in turn making the house a labyrinth.
  Investigators get to the bottom of these mysteries and spill secrets of their
  own.
  .
  Every game culminates in a supernatural seance. In this final act, confront each
  ghost about their mysteries, and each investigator about their secrets.
  .
  New to this edition
  .
  The same core game is the same, but we've revamped how the game is presented,
  taught, and built out tons of options for playing. We developed the roles and
  added some secondary goals for the ghosts and the investigators, leaned into the
  worldbuilding and creativity that both the ghosts and investigators do, and
  built a dramatic ending into every game of This Discord Has Ghosts in It.
  .
  The game comes with extensive facilitator support and tools, making the game
  easier to host and easier for new players to jump in. As far as extras, we've
  got a whole host of readymade haunts with Discord templates that include options
  for frights, ghosts, and investigators, a bunch of optional game modes and rules
  to change up the typical format all under the umbrella of the phantom lab. We
  even included step-by-step setup instructions (and premade templates) for folks
  that might not be Discord-savvy, but still want to play.

description:
  You are part of the Mount Qaf Exploitation Project. Months ago, your corporate
  backers discovered something marvelous. Something miraculous. A method to tunnel
  into another realm, into the legendary Mount Qaf, the barrier between the worlds
  of man and djinn. An opportunity to connect with another species! To leapfrog
  our understanding of metaphysics! History! Ourselves! A thing with unlimited
  potential to advance the human condition!
  .
  Naturally, you started doing horribly unethical science experiments and
  bickering over funding. This will probably kill you, and it'll probably suck,
  but that isn't important.
  .
  What is important is this: When they pick over the ruins of this horrorshow, you
  will have named the creatures gnawing at your bones.
  .
  This Is My Final Recording is a rules-light game that aims to create the
  apocalyptic logs so common in video games and found footage media. You play the
  employees of the Mount Qaf Exploitation Project as your capitalistic over-reach
  results in terrible and unknown creatures that try to murder you. It is designed
  to be easily playable through the restrictions of social distancing guidelines,
  with letters, emails, and text communications all valid modes of play.

  piece of their story as they attend a series of three parties while trying (and

  tenderness.

  Story:
  .
  Peace is scarce in the country of Aslande, and it has been at war with the
  neighbouring country of Eressia for centuries. When one battle ends, another
  inevitably begins, either months or years later. To Rhea, however, war is a
  distant concept; something she has heard about, but never witnessed. Born in a
  small, secluded village, Rhea occupies her life with more mundane concerns: her
  job at the local hospital, her playful bickering with her friend Asa, and her
  prayers for a successful harvest come autumn.
  .
  However, when Rhea's childhood friend, Luca, returns home to the village after
  fighting in one of Aslande's many wars, Rhea is suddenly faced with a problem.
  Why is Luca suddenly so cold, so distant? What did he see out on the
  battlefield, and how did it change him?
  .
  At the same time, new worries plague Rhea, as one of the patients at the
  hospital is suffering from a rather perplexing illness - and a failure to cure
  him could have some unpleasant outcomes...
  .
  About:
  .
  This World Unknown is a fantasy-themed otome game where the player assumes the
  role of the first person narrator, Rhea, and can romance four available guys.
  Which route you end up on depends on the choices made during the common route.
  .
  The character routes themselves are rather long, and have a lot of plot twists
  and world building (and lots and lots of characters).
  .
  The screen resolution is 1280x720.

  Toto Temple Deluxe is a fast-paced, local-multiplayer party game in which
  players must steal an egg-laying goat from their friends and try to keep it on
  their own head for as long as possible. You know, normal stuff.
  .
  Dashing Gameplay
  .
  Infinitely dash in any direction to swiftly move around and powerfully headbutt
  the goat carrier to steal its four-legged booty. Escape your jealous opponents
  and protect the goat by blocking their attacks with a well-timed shield pop!
  You'll "get their goat", guaranteed.
  .
  Classic Mode
  .
  Prove you're the ultimate shepherd in Classic mode: Gather 3k points first by
  holding on to the goat, collecting coins hatched from goat eggs (yeah... don't
  ask) and harnessing the power of powerful power-ups! Play as teams or in free-
  for-all.
  .
  Bomb Mode
  .
  Blast everyone's face off in Bomb mode: Be the first to grab the explosive goat
  (we know, stop interrupting us) and keep it long enough for it to detonate near
  your soon-to-be-dead rivals. Lose the goat and the timer resets! Play as teams
  or in free-for-all.
  .
  Temples
  .
  Each temple offers a unique, exploitable mechanic for you to discover. Use them
  wisely and outsmart your opponents like they don't even... what?... how did
  you..?
  .
  Bots
  .
  Bots will play with you whenever you want and for as long as you want. They
  never complain. They also never open up your fridge and ask if they can eat that
  pizza slice you got left from last night. Bots are awesome. Oh, and you can
  change their difficulty level too, because they will probably kick your ass-
  tonishing little bottom.

  Proud entry in the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality 2020.
  .
  -
  .
  In this game you and your friends play the role of characters in a very specific
  kind of horror story: normal and rational people, in a normal and rational
  world, that slowly starts to feel increasingly wrong and unsafe and disturbing,
  in a crescendo that will lead to a horrific epilogue.
  .
  This kind of horror focuses less on gore and violence, and more on unease and
  dread. Depending on your reactions to the game's inputs and twists you will
  experience a story reminiscent of some madness inducing H. P. Lovecraft novels,
  or rather akin to some psychedelic body-horror Clive Barker short stories.
  Either way, you play as the unfortunate protagonist of one such narrative.
  .
  Not everything will be nice and tidy by the end of the game. Questions might
  still linger unanswered, details might still feel odd and out of place, but
  overall your journey will be at an end, offering a degree of closure, in the
  vein of movies such as The Shining, Jacob's Ladder, The Wicker Man, The Others,
  and more.

  Especially when night arrives...
  .
  A veil of darkness falls over a quiet town in eastern Japan.
  .
  Fear and horror are freely wandering through its empty streets.

  Frequently Asked Questions
  .
  Q - So, what this game is about?
  .
  A - Towayami is essentially a horror adventure game.
  .
  I won't spoil too much about its story, but you'll have to explore, find and use
  items, solve puzzles... and survive.
  .
  Oh... and you'll also be immersed in darkness. All the time.
  .
  Q - I got it. It's as if I'm playing through the eyes of a blind person. Do I
  have any visual clues to help me out?
  .
  A - No, you don't. It's pitch black, so you'll have to make use of the four
  other senses available to the main character.
  .
  Mainly touch and sound, but you'll also get to know when something smells or
  tastes "different".
  .
  Anyway, your brain will soon get used to this condition and will start filling
  the gaps by creating visual references where, in fact, there are none.
  .
  Just like when you happen to wander in the dark in real life.
  .
  Q - Do I at least get a tutorial?
  .
  A - During the first part of the game, even if you won't find any "hand in hand"
  guide in it, you'll have all the time and relatively safe areas to learn how to
  play.
  .
  At first you'll be confused about who you are and what you have to do, but just
  by touching and examining your surroundings, you'll soon get enough information
  to understand all the important bits of the story.
  .
  Q - Hey, what's the deal with that black screenshot?
  .
  A - You know, taking meaningful screenshots from a game where the main feature
  is the absence of any graphics... was quite challenging. (_;)
  .
  Q - What was your main inspiration to make this game?
  .
  A - After I made "Five minutes a day", I kept thinking about how that short
  "graphicless" experience could've been expanded into a proper adventure game.
  .
  Coming up with a good story and a smooth gameplay wasn't a quick and easy task,
  so this game became a sort of "secret project" I kept working on in between my
  other releases.
  .
  Obviously, as previously stated in my other works (like with "The hair in the
  wall"), one of my biggest ispirations is Junji Ito and his works.
  .
  Many of his stories resonate really strong with Towayami.
  .
  Q - One last advice?
  .
  A - Only one? I'll give you three: keep your ears open, touch everything, and
  remember to use the "light touch" (right click) to examine things in a safe way.
  .

  It wasn't long before the different planets back home began colonizing  these

  Tricksters
  .
  Become a trickster charged with protecting a small village. Teach the villagers
  lessons and chase after your worldly desires. Then see what sordid tales these
  mortals tell of your bizarre interventions.
  .
  "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"
  .
  - Puck, A Midsummer Night's Dream
  .
  Tricksters is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-5 players. One player will take
  on the role of the Facilitator (GM), the other players will embody unique
  tricksters charged with protecting a village.
  .
  The Village is created collaboratively by answering questions, leaving the look
  and feel of the game setting up to the group. The tricksters are comprised of
  their True Form, Human Form, Tricks and Desires all of which are up to the
  players. There are no lists to chose from or powers to pick.
  .
  The game mechanics are simple focusing on the two most important things for a
  trickster, Teaching a Lesson and Fulfilling a Desire. When you need to make a
  roll you build a pool of six-sided dice based on if you have help, you're using
  a trick or are trying to resist a desire.
  .

developer: Essay Games
publisher: Essay Games
genre: Adventure
description:
  The Trolley is a first-person point and click narrative game about the sudden
  closure of a public transportation system in a fictional Rustbelt American city.
  .
  Set in the late 1950s, The Trolley invites players complete tasks in order to
  dismantle an incline railroad of a recently discontinued trolley line. As the
  player boards up the gatehouse, disposes of paperwork, and performs other
  closure duties, they are given a series of inner monolog choices that reflect on
  urban infrastructure, labor, and technological progress.
  .
  The stories, environments, architecture, and scenery are all pulled from
  extensive research Nicholas O'Brien has conducted over the past two years. The
  often untold narratives of the trolley closures from LA to Atlanta, Cincinnati
  to Pittsburgh interweave throughout this game. Using conventions from
  experimental filmmaking, essayistic moving image work, and contemporary story-
  driven indie games, The Trolley ask players to contemplate the ways in which the
  absence of the trolley has reshaped American civic space.

developer: Bee Scerri, Red World Press
publisher: Bee Scerri, Red World Press
genre: Role Playing
description:
  You are a soldier - a True Believer - caught in a millennia-long endless war of
  attrition, far from the warmth of your Birth-Star. None of you know the Enemy,
  though they are shaped like you, and some of your comrades claim they hear them
  speak in tongues not unlike yours through the trench walls, late at night...
  .
  True Believer is a roleplaying game for any number of players (including solo)
  about empathy, connection, and loss. You play as a soldier caught in a ceaseless
  war perpetrated by religious fanatics against an enemy you know nothing about.
  Through their abandoned trenches, their charred wargear, and their desperate
  charges, we learn who they are and how we are not so different. Through our own
  desperate acts, we learn what - who - we are forced to give up to dance to the
  lies of our masters.

  Reviews
  .
  "Wonderful improv-theatre piece where a religious doorknocker for a bizarre
  religion encounters a non-believer determined to shake their faith [...] There
  is something about the game that is benevolent where a lesser designer could
  have been cruel, and with the right players this game could be both educational
  and absolutely hilarious."
  .
  - Ivan at AGTN
  .
  "The scenario provides ample framework with *so much* room for building. It's
  really whatever you want it to be."
  .
  -Anonymous Judge from 200 Word RPG Contest
  .
  "The exploration of the relationship between a random citizen and the devout
  follower of a strange cult is interesting, and maybe uncomfortably real."

genre: Role Playing
description:
  You know that Stephen King book, with the scary clown? Well imagine that: last
  summer, I scrammed from the big city with my parents, and I went through a crazy
  adventure in the boondocks with my pals! We got way scared, we had some fun, I
  even got a girlfriend for a while... I could've made a novel out of it. Would
  have gotten myself the Booker Prize for sure (though I swear it's all true!).
  But I turned it into a roleplaying game instead! And just like in King's novel,
  I started to think about how things would be if our adventure weren't finished
  and 30 years later, we'd be back there, tying up things! That's why I'm calling
  the game 2 Crazy Summers: short and to the point. In a nutshell: we'll play
  teens who go adventuring during the summer and the same characters as adults!
  .
  TWO SUMMERS is a tabletop RPG for a GM and 3 to 5 players, who take the role of
  the same characters at two different time periods: as teenagers in the 1990s,
  living an unforgettable adventure, and as adults 30 years later, coming back to
  the same place and realizing the adventure is not over. The game is conceived
  for campaigns of 7-8 sessions, lasting around 3 hours each.
  .
  You'll like this game if you enjoy light drama, sunny adventures and good-
  hearted nostalgia! Its diceless system is deliberately very simple: you can
  explain it in a few minutes and its summary fits on a single page, so as to
  better put a greater emphasis on storytelling and roleplaying.
  .
  The zine features a complete game system plus everything you need to build your
  own campaign within its 60 pages:
  .
  Instructions to create characters and a relation map through a "session zero"
  .
  A thorough guide helping you to create your own TWO SUMMERS campaign, including
  advice, step by step examples and 25 semi-prepared subplots to insert into your
  story
  .
  Players and GM advice
  .
  A character and GM sheet
  .
  Beautiful illustrations and a full-color layout!

  Each round your workers will mine a square of the grid, you draw a card from
  your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts  and Diamonds  are
  resources and funding that you'll use for building and hiring units while Clubs
  and Spades  are natural formations and alien ruins. From alien probes and
  deactivated warmachines to toxic waste and boiling rivers, these strange
  discoveries will become part of your colony's layout and may provide unexpected
  benefits. Or you may just unleash an alien supersoldier, in which case you'll
  have to fight.
  .
  Combat in UMBRA is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking
  without weighing you down with book-keeping. Enemies follow a tower-defense
  style path towards your hold's entrance while you move your units in simple
  turn-based tactical combat. Utilise security systems, ranged attacks, and
  special units to face deadly foes or record your colony's epic demise.
  .
  UMBRA will also be supported with ongoing updates and expansions which bring new
  features such as space stations (coming soon), alien civilisations, madness, and
  more.
  .
  Or you can check out RISE (a dungeon building variant which tasks you with
  keeping your mutinious minions happy) or DELVE (the dwarf hold building game
  which kicked off the series).

developer: adamebell
publisher: adamebell
genre: Role Playing
description:
  A cracked throne, an imploded sun, revolution at the gates: disaster looms over
  the realm as self-serving nobles plot and scheme to shape the world to their
  liking. When those visions clash, turmoil erupts and the court is thrown into
  chaos.
  .
  Uneasy Lies the Head is a GM-less tabletop RPG where everyone plays a member of
  a tumultuous royal court. Each player chooses a playbook to define their
  character, and weaves a web of alliance and animosity with the other players.
  .
  The game plays out in a series of rounds. On a player's turn, they carry out a
  scene to show what their character is getting up to, and optionally execute
  either one of their playbook moves or a basic move to mechanically enforce their
  characters will on the narrative. Other players will vote on whether they want
  that action to succeed, and this opposition makes succeeding with this move more
  difficult. Can you form enough alliances to enact your secret plans, or will the
  realm collapse before your vision can come to fruition?
  .
  Each turn, a token is pulled out of the bag to see who gets to set the scene.
  .
  That player describes their character's actions, with the other players joining
  in with their own characters or some of the minor characters. At some point, it
  will be time to execute a move to make some drastic change to the story backed
  up by the game's mechanics. First, all the other players will vote on whether
  they want the move to succeed. This sets the die roll's difficulty.
  .
  Players will spend tokens to get dice to help or hinder the move's success.
  .
  Then the dice are rolled! For the roll to succeed, the active player needs as
  many unique die faces as the number of players who voted against the move + 1.
  Interfering players cancel dice that match their own.
  .
  Each move drives the story forward on both success and failure, and then a new
  turn starts. As play continues, the background disaster looms ever larger. The
  game comes with six setting backdrops to start your game from. Would you like to
  play as the General in of a space fleet, or the Monarch of a high school student
  body baffled by the sudden disappearance of their gym teacher? Take your pick
  and then play to find out what happens.

  Within a week, they had you hooked up to the temporal projection unit and were
  running limited tests. Microsecond jumps at first, then minutes. You were up to
  4 hour jumps in controlled conditions with only minimal deviations when you
  heard Sam had been infected. The doctors had said it'd be a matter of days.
  .
  You pleaded with your superiors to make the jump. The target: the terrorist cell
  delivering the canisters.
  .
  Against their better judgement, they hooked you up to the unit and entered the
  space-time coordinates. It was going to be the longest jump anyone had made: 36
  days in uncontrolled conditions. You prayed it would go well.
  .
  It didn't.
  .
  Unmoored is a solo journaling rpg based on the Wretched and Alone rules by Chris
  Bissette and Matt Sanders. You take on the role of a fresh recruit in the
  Tactical Unit of the Department of Special Relativity, entrusted with a crucial
  mission. However, something goes horribly wrong, and now you are lost in time
  and space, making uncontrolled jumps at random.
  .
  You cling to the hope that they will be able to locate the signal from your
  relativistic chronometer and bring you back somehow, but with every jump, you
  find your hope, sense of purpose and identity crumbling.

genre: Survival;Puzzle
description:
  Uno, a newborn lifeform composed of dense steel, buzzy circuits and disjointed,
  static memories, wakes up, looking through a frosted cerulean ceiling. On its
  inside drive, weird images, and a text file with instructions.
  .
  The Subject's test has begun. Meet me at the top of the Obelisk.
  .
  "Where am i?"               "How did i came into existence?"
  "For what purpose?"                   "By the hands of whom?"
  .
  Isolated in a hidden point of our universe, the Obelisk is  a true wonder land,
  far from the 01's chains of morality and ethics. A place of true scientific
  progress and rebellion against the deterministic laws of nature's causality.
  .
  There's no other way. All the answers, reasons and a way out, lies at the top.
  .
  Unobelisk is a solo turn based, exploration game focused on resource management
  and puzzle solving.
  .
  With level design inspired by classic Resident Evil games and Metroidvanias,
  puts the player in the logic circuits of Uno, exploring an obelisk-shaped space
  station for a path to the top of the structure, where a way out is promised.
  .
  The not exactly linear progression of the game is blocked by a number of
  riddles, passwords, keys and the mysterious threat of the primordial ghosts,
  along with your own Subject brothers and even the 4 scientists themselves.
  .
  On the other hand, optional puzzle solving and exploration are rewarded with
  upgrade modules, that grants better ammo capacity, maximum health boost, greater
  evasive perfomance or stronger offensive capabilities.
  .
  Under normal conditions, the game can be finished between 10 and 20 hours,
  though finishing in less time is possible by skipping text content or simply
  knowing your way through the Obelisk.
  .
  A Puzzle helper function is available on the options menu for those stuck in
  Unobelisk. It doesn't skip any puzzle, but hints to solve them gets more obvious
  in some text files or even on the map.
  .
  There's also a challenge difficulty mode if the default one feels too easy. A
  ranking system exists exclusively for this mode, rating the player's performance
  based on the final game playtime, number of times healed in restoration devices
  or the collection of optional modules.
  .
  Controllers are natively supported. The ones using the DirectInput standard will
  have problems with button placement but there's a menu option fixing this.
  .
  While there's only one active dev behind Unobelisk,  it uses assets, music, raw
  graphic materials and others from a number of people that makes their great work
  available with free licenses. Credits can be seen in the game's options menu.

  A Game for one player with a deck of playing cards, 3 six-sided die, and either
  a lighter, scissors & tape or a red marker & a black marker.
  .
  UIT//MS is a game about dealing with the social anxiety around interacting with
  the same people day in, day out, over the course of who knows how long.
  .
  It takes place on a single day in one person's life and represents the last hour
  or so before their work day ends.
  .
  During play you build a spread of cards that represents both the people you're
  talking to and the conversations you have during that time frame.
  .
  You roll dice to determine how your character perceives the impact the
  conversations have on their friends, and how they themselves feel after. You
  answer question prompts to determine details, and you try to make it to the end
  of the day.
  .
  CONTENT WARNING:
  .
  This is a game about anxiety, and playing it can lead to a headspace related to
  those kinds of feelings. It also involves scissors, tape, and sometimes fire
  (though it does have alternate rules for those events allowing markers instead).
  Do not use these elements if they make you uncomfortable or you cannot do them
  safely. Burn things in a sink with a working faucet or a cup of water nearby,
  and be careful to not burn yourself.

  The Valley of Super Flowers is a 2D Platform Action game based on the story of
  the the valley which had been forcefully captured by an Evil Satanis ruler.

  The valley of Super Flowers was a holy place where flowers having supernatural
  ability used to live. Flowa, a Super Flower, was born in the valley. He spent
  his childhood in the same place and attended schools there. But later, an Evil
  Satanis ruler had taken control over the valley of Super Flowers. The quality of
  life of the flowers living in the area have been declining day by day. Many were
  having a hard time to live under a roof and were under a strict Satanis military
  surveillance all the time. However, the most of the flower world was under the
  control of the Good Flowaris Ruler. Flowa had been supported by the Police of
  Flowaris and they asked him to help them recapture the Valley of Super Flowers
  and destroy the Evil ruler. He had accepted their proposal and went to the Enemy
  territory with an aim to free the people of the state from the Bad ruler. He saw

description:
  It's the late 2000s, school's out for summer, and you're headed out of town to
  stay with your grandparents in the idyllic Yorkshire village of Wymton-on-Tee.
  Your summer plans include exploring the countryside, and most importantly
  enjoying Grampy's famous chocolate chip cookies.... except that you're pretty
  sure that Vladimir Alucard, Grommy and Grampy's new neighbour is an evil
  bloodsucking vampire.

  which immerse you in impeccable 2000s vibes.

description:
  Please note you get a free digital copy of this game when you buy a boxed
  edition of Vegetables Deluxe from Psytronik (on cassette) for 7.99 (standard) or
  14.99 (Cassette).
  .
  Vegetables Deluxe
  .
  This game must be played on a real Commodore 64 or an emulator (I recommend
  VICE)
  .
  Coding, music and ingame graphics by Mike Richmond
  .
  Title screen and background graphics by Andy Cashmore
  .
  Controls:
  .
  Use a joystick in Port 2. While playing, press P to pause and un-pause the game.
  Press Q from pause mode to quit to the menu screen.
  .
  Playing Instructions
  .
  On the menu screen, use joystick left and right to select a game mode. Joystick
  up and down changes between in-game music and sound effects. Press fire to start
  the game.
  .
  The object of the game is to make lines of three or more matching vegetables. To
  do so, you can swap the position of any two vegetables on the play screen by
  holding down fire and pushing in a direction. When there are no valid moves left
  then the board is shuffled - until you run out of shuffles, then it's game over!
  .
  Match three vegetables and they are removed from the board, with new shapes
  dropping down to replace them. Occasionally an immovable block will be dropped.
  These can only be removed by strategically dropping them until a line of three
  or more immovable blocks is made. Match four shapes in a row to destroy a full
  row or line and match five to destroy all matching shapes and get an extra
  shuffle.
  .
  Game Modes
  .
  There are four game modes, offering a gradually increasing level of challenge.
  .
  Casual
  .
  In casual mode, the emphasis is on a relaxing game, with very few immovable
  blocks being dropped. It is still possible to run out of moves, so don't get too
  complacent!
  .
  Classic
  .
  In classic mode, immovable blocks are periodically dropped, making it gradually
  harder to make matches.
  .
  Shopping
  .
  The objective of shopping mode is to make the number of matches indicated on the
  left hand side of the screen. At first you need to match 3 of each shape to beat
  the level, with the number of matches you need to achieve increasing each time
  .
  Countdown
  .
  Countdown mode is the biggest challenge of all. You have a short time to make a
  match before the timer runs out. If you fail to match before then, you lose a
  shuffle. In this mode, you do not lose a shuffle when there are no valid matches
  - only when the countdown timer runs out.

  .
  "It's a very impressive little adventure that delivers a tense, atmospheric and
  cerebral horror experience. The puzzle design is excellent and it generally
  stays clear of cheap jump scares, yet still has some very scary moments and a
  deep sense of dread throughout. There's no doubt in your mind that you're
  dabbling with dark arts that are best left alone, but the clever use of
  environmental storytelling does a good job of revealing why you're pushed to
  such desperate measures. Highly recommended."

developer: Washing-Up Software Projects, VideogameScrapbook
publisher: Washing-Up Software Projects, VideogameScrapbook
genre: Action
description:
  Sometime in the mid-1980s development began on a technology that, had it gone to
  market, would have changed video gaming as we know it.  A complete virtual-
  reality system meant for arcades, utilizing twin head-mounted vector monitors of
  the type used in games such as Battlezone, Tempest and Star Wars.
  .
  Sadly, funding for the project dried up before it reached completion, and the
  first game for the system - VekWars - never saw the light of day, continuing to
  exist only in rumor and a handful of blurry photographs from the period.
  .
  But now a team of digital archaeologists based in Austin, Texas have
  successfully extracted the source code for this game from a dusty 8-inch floppy
  disk provided by an anonymous benefactor.  We are pleased to present VekWars -
  fully updated to support modern virtual-reality systems (or non-VR monitors) and
  playable for the first time in over 35 years!
  .
  Note: VekWars is best experienced in VR, but if you're using the itch.io
  launcher, sometimes it can't find your VR headset.  If this is the case, try
  launching the executable directly.
  .
  How To Play
  .
  Welcome to the year 2385.  Humanity is locked in a deadly war with the evil
  Xilorian Empire. The key to winning this war lies in the unique properties of
  Vektrox Ore.  Found on only one planet in the galaxy, human mining colonies are
  under constant attack by invading Xilorian forces.
  .
  You are in charge of defending a cache of blue ore crates from waves of Xilorian
  ships that will attempt to steal them.  Your defense turret sits in the middle
  of a ring of crates, and is equipped with a powerful laser cannon, three
  missiles, and a shield system to protect you from enemy attacks.  Xilorian
  saucers may appear at any point around you and will fly in and attempt to steal
  the crates. Point at them with your targeting reticule and pull the trigger to
  fire your lasers and destroy them. If an enemy saucer is taking off with a
  crate, they will drop it if shot, but be careful not to accidentally hit the
  crate and destroy it yourself! If all crates are lost, then the game is over.
  .
  Watch out for red enemy fighters that will fire missiles at your turret. Shoot
  the missiles before they hit you to avoid losing shield energy.  After three
  direct hits your turret will be destroyed and the game will be over.
  .
  Use the secondary fire button to launch a highly-destructive NovaRocket at the
  enemy.
  .
  At the end of each attack wave your turret's energy shield is recharged, and a
  new NovaRocket provided, up to a maximum of three.
  .
  DEFEND THE CRATES!

description:
  Race cars in classic motorsport style. Each corner is a chance to outmaneuver
  the other drivers, every straight a flat out drag race. Fast-paced strategy
  relies on your reflexes to pull off split second maneuvers. Feel your car's
  momentum, find the rhythm of the track, and drive like a racing driver.
  .
  Guide your car's driving line to take each corner quickly while finding a gap to
  overtake other drivers. On straights, be quick on your gears and late on the
  brakes to get to the corner first, always on the edge of spinning or crashing
  out. Spend an entire lap trying to close the distance to the car ahead, choosing
  the right corner to make your move.
  .
  Other drivers break your rhythm, forcing you to adapt your driving and how you
  tackle corners. Each track is unique and you have to learn the fastest route
  through corners and sections. Rain changes your car's behavior while you deal
  with decreased visibility. With a simple control scheme, victory will come from
  out-thinking and out-driving everyone else.
  .
  Inspired by the classic era of formula racing around the Mediterranean, each
  environment is a colorful and hand-built racetrack, all alongside an originally
  produced surf rock soundtrack.

  Try the Lite Version         Get the Soundtrack
  .
  Vilmonic is a living virtual world. Your goal is to bring life back from the
  brink of extinction.
  .
  Protect and breed unique pixel-art life forms whose pixels and color have
  meaning. Experiment with natural and artificial selection. Craft tools,
  construct buildings and change the environment. Uncover the secrets of the past
  as you dig up ancient tech and fend off the mindless haywire zombitons.
  .
  Don't be fooled by the SUPER CUTE look, Vilmonic is a deep and complex
  ARTIFICIAL LIFE SIMULATOR!
  .
  Evolving genetic code generates each creature's pixel-art body.
  .
  The shape, or morphology, of each animatroid or fungol is determined by its
  genes. Genes control the bending of internal bones or branches. Pixels cover the
  bones to create the shape of the body. The shape of the body and the number of
  different pixels determine the physiology of the life form.
  .
  Pixels and body shape determine biological function: hydration, nutrient use,
  movement, perception...
  .
  Each life form has a metabolism that processes hydration and nutrients at a rate
  determined by the metabo gene. The larger the life form (the more pixels in its
  body), the more hydration and nutrients it will need each metabolic cycle.
  Surface area determines how much hydration each life form evaporates. The more
  wrinkled the body is, the more surface area there is.
  .
  Simple graph-shaped brains create emergent behavior: fear, agression,
  attraction...
  .
  A simple set of rules, derived from genes, controls the behavior of each
  animatroid. Animatroids have external sensors (motion/scent/water) and internal
  sensors (hunger/stress/thirst). Animatroids' brains have attraction/repulsion
  relationships between these sensors. It is these relationships that determine
  each animatroid's behavior.
  .
  Natural selection and breeding are the only way to evolve your life forms -
  unless you "cheat" with genetic engineering!
  .
  Your animatroids and fungols will evolve over many generations into new species.
  The genetic code of each life form is passed down to its offspring during
  reproduction, with a chance of mutation. Evolution is a slow process. To speed
  things up, try crafting and drinking a lot of sugary beverages. Toxic waste can
  also be useful (and dangerous!) It can cause drastic mutations in offspring.
  .
  Export your creatures and share them with friends!
  .

description:
  On a sunny day, Lil Viv and her Uncle Bob visited the forest, where Viv saw a
  mysterious mansion. Not thinking twice, she went into the abandoned house before
  Bob could even try to stop her. Standing in the hallway, the floor under their
  feet suddenly broke down. Viv and Bob fell into the basement, not knowing what
  will happen next.
  .
  Viv and Bob is a puzzle game made with GB Studio 1.1 where you play Viv and Bob,
  trying to exit the many rooms of the mansion's basement. While Bob is strong
  enough to push blocks to their designated places, Lil Viv is light enough to
  walk above insecure parts of the floor. Bob and Viv are trapped in two sides of
  a mirror. The room Bob is standing in is a mirrored version of Viv's room and
  vice versa. Actions on one side of the mirror affect the other side as well.
  Switch between both protagonists and always think about both sides of the
  mirror.
  .
  This is a game for the original Game Boy. The download contains a Game Boy ROM.
  The ROM can be played on emulators or even a real Game Boy if you are using a
  flashcart.
  .
  The current Version 1.0 of the game contains a set of levels. I will try to add
  more levels with Version 1.1. Moreover I will try to add some cutscenes and a
  animated prologue and epilouge. Obviously I will also fix bugs if I find them.

  The gameplay is simple. You have two buttons; one moves you up and the other
  lets you glide. Typically you'll be holding the glide button to slow your
  descent when an obstacle comes near so you can grind along the top or bottom for
  points. The closer you are the more points you'll earn. You'll crash if the
  center of the Wisp contacts an obstacle.
  .
  Below is a short overview of how this game works.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Simple gameplay that's easy to pick up and hard to master. Designed for both
  short spurts and long sessions.
  .
  4 Game Modes each with a unique twist.
  .
  In Classic Mode you'll start to lose points the farther you go, so you want to
  get as many as quickly as possible.
  .
  In Caravan Mode you have one minute to score as much as possible. Crashing will
  lower the amount of time you have.
  .
  Survival Mode is the most complex mode. A timer is always ticking down but can
  be refilled by collecting luster and having a high multiplier. The game gets
  faster and you earn more points the further you make it.
  .
  In Traveler Mode there are 40 premade levels each with 5 goals to complete. You
  will face unique obstacles not found in the other modes.
  .
  Accessibility options that let you customize the game's looks, controls, and
  difficulty.
  .
  You can change the appearance of the game and character to better suit what
  makes you comfortable.
  .
  Supports mouse, keyboard, and gamepad. All with fully remappable controls!
  .
  Dreamy ambient music that partially reacts to how you play.

  ***Development of Volo Airsport is on a permanent hiatus***
  .
  Full source code available at: https://github.com/mzandvliet/VoloAirsport
  .
  Latest version: v3.7.4 Parachute Release
  .
  Volo Airsport is about the joys of skydiving and the beauty of nature. Try your
  hand at wingsuits, either flying as close to the mountains as possible, or
  soaring high and enjoying the view.
  .
  Flying with a human body is an experience that is fundamentally different from
  piloting other aircraft; it can be as elegant as it can be clumsy. As such, Volo
  completely simulates the motion of your body, and you can see, hear and feel the
  way it interacts with the air around you.
  .
  The core gameplay is all about learning to master the complex interplay between
  your body, the wind and gravity. Your first few flights can be quite like
  learning how to walk for the first time! Don't worry though, unlike in real life
  you can always try again.
  .
  Enjoy, and blue skies!

  "Journeys begin and end; the story does not."
  .
  -Old Mareman Proverb
  .
  Much of Marema was destroyed by the Empire of Garen decades ago. The radioactive
  fallout destroyed most of the tropical rainforests and verdant countryside for
  which Marema was famous, leaving behind only a desert waste known as "The
  Deadlands".
  .
  Now, two young adventurers prepare to claim their piece of the Deadlands, not
  realizing that they will soon be swept up in the latest chapter of a struggle
  that has been playing out for thousands of years; a war for the very future of
  mankind.
  .
  And it remains to be seen if they will survive the Volt Age...
  .
  ------------------------------
  .
  A Dynamic World with a Rich History:
  .
  -Learn about the history of Marema, expose the dark secrets of The Reclamation,
  and uncover a vast struggle between mankind and the gods reaching back thousands
  of years.
  .
  -Interact with the world around you in a variety of ways. Pick locks, scrap old
  machinery, and use tools to take control of your surroundings.
  .
  A massive continent, begging to be explored...
  .
  A Story You Can Play at Your Own Pace:
  .
  The story begins with two adventurers seeking to claim their piece of the
  Deadlands...
  .
  -No quests to save the world at Level 5 here! Take your time learning the
  nuances of the world as you are eased into a story which grows and advances
  organically. Most towns will continue to offer new challenges long after you
  first discover them.
  .
  -Level grinders rejoice! New quests and areas will continue to open up as the
  party's level (and reputation) grows, with optional challenges all the way up to
  Level 90!
  .
  -Two very different paths await you! Save the world, seek the truth, and fight
  for what you believe...the choice is yours.
  .
  Uncover secrets forgotten for hundreds of years as you explore...
  .
  A Lively and Unique Cast of Characters:
  .
  -Meet a diverse cast of more than a dozen characters, each with their own
  reasons for choosing to help (or hinder) the protagonists.
  .
  -In addition to their normal abilities, many allies possess passive skills which
  will let you interact with the environment in new ways or even add unique buffs
  to the party!
  .
  The tech-savvy Nyla is able to locate valuables the party would otherwise
  miss...
  .
  An Experience Like No Other:
  .
  -Immerse yourself in an amazing soundtrack featuring works by Aaron Krogh, J.C.
  Brickston, Darren Curtis, and  world-renowned composer Hiroki Kikuta!
  .
  -Battle against over 60 original enemies, ranging from the simple Barrel Sludge
  to the terrifying Goni, with several hostile factions and nearly a dozen unique
  human foes to round out the threats your party will face.
  .
  -Nearly 400 pieces of gear ranging from swords and shields to sniper rifles and
  force fields means you can customize your characters to suit your play style.
  .
  Unleash powerful abilities on a variety of unique and deadly foes...

game: Vulture (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/V/Vulture (USA)/Vulture (USA).json
developer: Cubic Timeline Productions
publisher: Cubic Timeline Productions
genre: Shooter
description:
  Vulture is a build-em-up arcade shooter with a retro aesthetic. In Vulture, the
  player controls a drone provided by the local military as it engages various
  types of enemies who have invaded the planet. As the player progresses through 9
  levels of intense combat, they will encounter increasingly larger and more
  powerful enemies. Players are ranked at the end of each level based on their
  score and number of enemies destroyed. High rankings give better rewards!
  .
  Destroyed enemy drones will drop credits, power-ups and blocks that the play can
  use to improve their drone. Players can use the in-depth build screen to create
  new designs of drones to use. As the player progresses, they will unlock larger
  templates to build their drones. The design grid starts at 8x8, but increases up
  to 32x32 by the final levels.
  .
  Blocks used in the construction of drones all have specific attributes that
  change how the players drone will function. All blocks have Power and CPU costs
  that must be met using system blocks in order for the drone to be able to
  function.
  .
  Hull Blocks: Increase durability and provide structure
  .
  Wing Blocks: Increase maneuverability
  .
  Weapon Blocks: Provide firepower
  .
  System Blocks: Provide Power and CPU for weapons
  .
  Shield Blocks: Provide additional protection
  .
  Engine Blocks: Increase speed
  .
  Legendary Blocks: ????????
  .
  Players can also equip radar systems which will allow enemies to be located
  before they come onto the screen. The radar can be improved to have increased
  detection range and can allow players to plan their route through a level with
  ease.
  .
  Players have access to 5 different weapon types: Plasma, Missiles, Orbs, Flak
  and Laser. Each of these weapon systems has a Tier 1 and Tier 2 variant. The
  Tier 2 variants are more powerful but consume more power and CPU, and can't be
  unlocked until the later levels. Players can also equip bomb systems that allow
  the use of a large, screen-wiping weapon once per level.
  .
  There are 9 levels of Campaign gameplay as well as a Bonus level that can be
  unlocked by meeting specific criteria in the game. Levels can be replayed for
  higher scores and for players to collect more blocks to build with. Each level
  consists of many waves of enemies followed by a boss. Some levels also have a
  mini-boss halfway through. At the end of a level, players are given a score
  (which is the amount of in-game credits received), a letter score (S rank to D-
  rank), and several items and blocks based on their achieved rank.
  .
  Giving players the ability to design their own drones will allow for many
  different strategies to be used. For example, weapons all have different rates
  of fire, which can be modified by capacitor systems installed on a drone. Using
  a single weapon type will yield a very different play experience than using
  multiple weapon systems. Changing the shape and size of a drone will greatly
  affect its maneuverability. The player must balance many factors to create a
  drone design that will be successful!
  .
  Fight! Collect! Design! Defend Your World!

  The Witch
  .
  A hero that has tapped into powerful natural currents and elements of the world,
  The Witch has had dark truths revealed to them for this price of power. Can you
  navigate the ladder of power whilst avoiding the dangers the climb risks?
  .
  The Witch has themes and inspirations from H.P Lovecraft, Dr. Who and Isaac
  Asimov while its mechanics take after The Sailor Scouts, Sora from Kingdom
  Hearts, the Crest Wielders of Fire Emblem: Three Houses and even Tony Tony
  Chopper from One Piece with powerful Transformations and moves inspired by
  classic Table Top spells.
  .
  The Ace
  .
  Some might call you a muscle head, a brute or even a bully what with your
  eagerness to tussle and fight but they don't really get it. You've never been
  good with words, you've only been able to express yourself through actions and
  sometimes those actions are a knuckle sandwich. But it might just be a silver
  lining now that you're in the hero business because a lot of people need a punch
  or two, least of all your Adversary.
  .
  The Ace is based primarily on the drama and themes of Shonen Manga, specifically
  the protagonist of such and the various rivals they hold throughout their
  various series such as Ichigo and Byakuya from Bleach, Naruto and Sasuke from
  Naruto and Goku and classic rival Vegeta from Dragon Ball.
  .
  The Ronin
  .
  You were a protege at one point, or something approaching it, until disaster
  struck. Something happened to your would-be mentor, or they simply no longer
  required your services and you found yourself on your own. Society doesn't look
  kindly on those tossed aside or unable to help those who were offering their
  help in the first place, The Ronin now only really able to rely on their own
  talents, their team and a whole lot of luck.
  .
  The Ronin's themes center around abandonment and stigmatization on a social
  level as well as self reliance and found family. As well, The Ronin deals with
  luck and the fickleness of fortune. The Ronin is inspired by famous Ronin of
  media such as Mugen from Samurai Champloo, Miyamoto Usagi from the classic comic
  Usagi Yojimbo, Ogami Itto from Lone Wolf and Cub and even the futuristic Spike
  Spiegel from Cowboy Bepop.

  "Summed up in a single word, it would be 'beautiful.'" - David Wolinsky, Common
  Sense Media
  .
  "An introspective 'Oregon Trail'" - David G. Allan, CNN
  .
  "A remarkable experiment in translation. As contemplative as its source
  material, it forces an anti-reflexive pace and coddles at its center an
  appreciation of calm and quiet."  - Jason Sheehan, NPR Reading the Game
  .
  Play as philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau in his experiment in
  self-reliant living at Walden Pond. Live off the land, seek out the small
  wonders and beauties of the woods, and find balance between your need to survive
  and your desire to find inspiration.
  .
  Walden, a game is a six hour, exploratory narrative that begins in the summer of
  1845 when Thoreau moved to the Pond and built his cabin there. You follow in his
  footsteps, surviving in the woods by finding food and fuel and maintaining your
  shelter and clothing.
  .
  At the same time as you strive to survive off the land, you are encouraged to
  explore the beauty of the woods and the pond, which hold a promise of a sublime
  life beyond your basic needs. And, you can interact with characters from
  Thoreau's life including mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, sister Sophia Thoreau,
  editor Horace Greeley, activist A. Bronson Alcott, naturalist Louis Agassiz
  among others.
  .
  The game follows the loose narrative of Thoreau's first year in the woods, with
  each season holding its own challenges for survival and possibilities for
  inspiration. It features the voices of Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild, Milk) as
  Henry David Thoreau, Jim Cummings (Darkwing Duck, Sonic the Hedgehog) as Ralph
  Waldo Emerson, Misty Lee (The Last of Us, BioShock Infinite), and Tony Amendola
  (Stargate SG-1, Once Upon a Time) as Bronson Alcott.
  .
  Walden, a game has been a labor of love by a very small core team working over
  the past ten years. We sincerely hope you enjoy the experience and welcome your
  feedback! If you are an educator and would like to use Walden in your classroom,
  please contact us via our support form.

  -----------------------
  .
  You've been hired by Walking Doggos, a subsidiary of Good Boyes, Inc.
  .
  Your job? Walking the goodest doggos every day for minimum wage while their
  owners are at work.
  .
  It doesn't matter how many dogs you walk, or how hard you work, you get paid the
  same no matter what.
  .
  So, what does a clever slacker like you do? As little as possible without
  getting fired.
  .
  Walking Doggos
  .
  A Game Of Being Barely Adequate
  .
  Walking Doggos is a trick-taking game, where the goal is to take fewer tricks
  than your opponents while still at least winning one trick. There are six suits
  of cards: Great Danes, Labradors, Shiba Inus, Beagles, Corgis, and Pugs ranked
  by size of the breed. Each suit has a card numbered 1 through 8 representing the
  number of that breed that need to be walked.
  .
  Players each have a hand of 5 cards held face out, so that only other players
  can see what cards are being held. Players take turns giving clues to other
  players as to what cards are in their hand. Once every player has 3 clues,
  players take turns betting how many tricks they are going to take. After all
  players have made their bets, players take turns playing a card face up into a
  pack to be walked. The player who played the highest ranked doggo wins the pack.
  Players get points based on the number of packs they take compared to what they
  bet. The winner is the player who did the least amount of work necessary without
  being fired.

game: Wampus (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/W/Wampus (USA)/Wampus (USA).json
developer: John Vanderhoef
publisher: John Vanderhoef
genre: Adventure
description:
  Wampus is an overhead arcade narrative adventure game developed as a homebrew
  for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
  .
  The wampus live on a planet invaded by colonialists, who farm and mine the land
  for its natural resources. These resource-stripping activities threaten the
  local flora and fauna, especially the Mountain Wampus, who get hunted for their
  treasure.
  .
  As a young wampus, players set out to rid the planet of the settler invaders and
  restore harmony to the land. While a fun lark, Wampus explores themes of
  environmentalism, conservationism, stewardship of the land, and the destructive
  nature of colonialism.
  .
  * * *
  .
  Wampus is the first game in the MULEniverse series, which narratively extends
  the work of Danielle Bunten Berry's MULE economic simulator game.
  .
  The MULEniverse games include:
  .
  1. Wampus
  .
  2. Wart Worm Wingding
  .
  3. Bat Lizard Bonanza
  .
  4. Leggite Luta Livre
  .
  5. neMULEsis

  .
  Hold B and press A -- Wampus Burrow (once unlocked)
  .
  Hold A and press B -- Wampus Rock Bomb (once unlocked)
  .
  ***
  .
  FOR BEST EXPERIENCE: I recommend getting an original NES controller and a USB
  adapter for it. You can find one here or here.
  .
  For really enterprising types, this game is fully playable on an actual NES. You
  can use either an Everdrive, a PowerPak, or flash an empty cart, as long as each
  has mapper 30 support.
  .
  * * *
  .
  Wampus was made possible thanks to NESMaker, an engine developed to make NES
  development a reality for people who are not versed in assembly language.
  .
  In order to play Wampus, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend FCEUX. Many
  emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper NESMaker uses for
  its games.
  .
  Once you have FCEUX downloaded, start it up and open the Wampus.nes ROM. The
  game should work fine.
  .
  FOR MAC USERS: Download OpenEMU for Mac. When you open the program, right click
  on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select "Default
  Core." Then select FCEU.

description:
  Games usually start from the setting, and then the players create their
  characters according to that particular setting.
  .
  This game is the opposite.
  .
  First players choose their characters, and then the GM create the setting around
  the chosen PCs. They can then use the other characters present in this book as
  pre-made SPCs, or create their own with their unique Abilities or a mix of the
  Abilities listed here. The only important thing is to create characters fun to
  play!
  .
  Abilities are the core of the - few - rules: characters can share the same, but
  every character has at least one unique Ability that make them different from
  the rest of the party.
  .
  In this book you will find characters with Abilities created for a fantasy
  setting, but I'd like to write many more in the future, with sci-fi and horror
  settings in mind.
  .
  WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN WANDERERS;
  .
  A super easy game system so you can get the show on the road right away!
  Seriously, the rules take 3 pages.
  .
  17 characters created with a fantasy setting in mind. You can use them to try
  Wanderers - or you can adapt them to your favourite fantasy game!
  .
  WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY:

  -This book

  -Friends

game: Wandering Dreams (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/W/Wandering Dreams (USA)/Wandering Dreams (USA).json
developer: Sleepy Sasquatch Games
publisher: Sleepy Sasquatch Games
genre: Adventure
description:
  Wandering Dreams is an adventure RPG zine about exploring a Soulsborne and
  Lovecraft inspired world full of strange and unique locations, beings, and
  things that are waiting for discovery by the player. It is designed for solo
  play and uses custom rules for combat and encounters. Using a deck of standard
  playing cards and a 6 sided die (d6) the player sets off on a story telling
  experience into the world of the dream.
  .
  During your adventure you can observe, approach, fight, and run from the
  denizens of this world by your choice. Explore the world using the card pulls
  and dice for prompts as well as information on what you are dealing with. A
  journal is highly recommended to track where you have been, what you have seen,
  and how your character is doing.
  .
  The player explores the world using the zine, a deck of standard cards (jokers
  removed), their favourite d6 (6-sided die), a journal (or paper), plus a writing
  instrument (pen, pencil, quill and ink, etc.). The deck is separated into suits
  to represent different elements in the story that will be drawn as you progress.
  .
  SPADES : Locations (here, there, anywhere)
  .
  HEARTS : Events (happens location to location or in a location)
  .
  DIAMONDS : Things (weapons, attire, tools, antiquities, etc.)
  .
  CLUBS : Beings (bad, neutral, people, beasts, the unknown)
  .
  After drawing a card  the player will roll their D6 and find the card suit,
  value, and rolled result in the tables provided inside the zine. The zine
  provides alternative play styles for players who want to challenge themselves
  further with story writing and character development.
  .
  Character creation has been streamlined to a die roll before starting the
  adventure. Each character will have predetermined stats, starting equipment, and
  a small backstory prompt for the player to work with.
  .
  A total of 6 character archetypes will be included in the zine to start with
  templates for additional custom characters as the player sees fit.
  .
  Characters can be built in the game and transferred over to other game engines.
  Wandering Dreams can provide you a template for backstory creation and character
  development.
  .
  Combat is designed to use as few cards as possible and your trusty D6. The
  player always attacks first and can vanquish many small Beings of the world in
  one round to keep the story moving forward and remove the need for constant die
  rolls to get through an encounter.
  .
  Alternatively the Player can choose to Escape and avoid the fight all together
  if looking for more of a exploration style to play or if you encounter a Being
  that is far beyond your abilities or causes too much fear.
  .
  Encounters can be lucrative to find new Things of interest inside the world of
  Wandering Dreams but can also be deadly and ultimately lead to...
  .
  The game ends when the player chooses to awaken from the dream world by death,
  achieving their end purpose, or choosing to awaken from the dream.
  .
  Finding a suitable end point can be difficult and so the zine will include a
  small list of ideas to get you started with objectives that reflect the world
  being explored. These can be expanded on with your own ideas and empty templates
  will be included for listing your concepts.
  .
  As you explore the dream more and learn about what is possible the options will
  continue to expand until perhaps the Beings and Things encountered become too
  much to handle. The game can be packed away and picked up again at another time
  as the player chooses.
  .
  A large part of zines is the ease of access for everyone. Perhaps you want a new
  'uber' table of items to pick from... modify the provided Things tables in the
  provided blank templates to create something new or just move around what is
  provided!
  .
  Instructions for hacking the zine will be included at the back of it for all
  designers looking to explore their favourite worlds or original creations using
  the deck of cards and d6 system. The hacking process is something I believe in
  greatly for everyone interested in game design and I wouldn't have started this
  project without doing it myself. Some of my favourites include;  Tunnel Goons,
  Alone Among The Stars, and  Take Root.

  We don't talk that easily.

  We don't even feel very much.

  At least, I don't."

  Megumi Shimizu's life is routine and monotonous. Get up, go to school early,

  anywhere...and she's fine with that.

  She's used to it, just like she's used to the cold, numbing winters in her
  hometown of Ikigai.
  .
  Then one day, a new transfer arrives. A new transfer who is instantly liked by
  her classmates and teacher, who is everything Megumi is not. Bubbly, sweet,
  happy, social.
  .
  And for some reason, this new girl, Hinata Mikami, thinks Megumi is nice and
  wants to be friends. And Megumi is stunned to find she likes Hinata too...
  .
  Little by little, Megumi's cold and unfeeling world sounds less and less

  Warm then Hot is a game to be played in real life with your friends. It asks for
  intimacy; maybe a radical type, of openness, of warmth, of being supported by
  the people who love you and who you love. It's an experience about tenderness,
  about finding the words for the things that hurt you, and finding a common
  ground with the people who you share space and community with.
  .
  All you need to play is some friends, a fire source that's safe to use, paper
  and pencils, and some marshmallows -- or any other roastable treat.
  .
  As someone who is aromantic, Warm Then Hot is an aspirational game; a game where
  we can delve into our pain freely with our friends, and eschew traditional
  relationship roles where we only burden those we are romantically involved in,
  and for that reason it's also my submission to Fraudulent Gays Jam 2020.

description:
  The human world has room for many monarchs, but The Humming Woods has only one
  Queen. This six-legged Mother of Millions dines exclusively on an elixir said to
  cure any ill, or even extend one's life... a royal jelly of matchless quality.
  Few dare attempt to steal any jelly away, protected as it is by the swarms that
  live in Her remote hive, The Six-Form Heart.
  .
  But what if one had grander dreams than of a waxed sack of purloined jelly?
  .
  In this Trophy Dark incursion, your treasure-hunters will journey into a dark
  and bee-filled wood in search of their dearest desire... but will find nothing
  but destruction.
  .
  A WARM AND PLEASANT HUM is a prize-winning entry from 2019's official Trophy
  Writing Contest. Judge Jason Cordova (Gauntlet) called it "both beautiful and
  terrifying."
  .
  This game uses Trophy Dark and contains all the rules you need to run the
  scenario.

description:
  The Watching Book is an artifact left behind by the oracles of The Singing
  Plain. It is a testament to their culture, homeland, and history as written by
  generations of their beloved spiritualists. It is a gateway into a place that is
  long gone, accessible to us now only through games.
  .
  This Zine is set in the world of the Soothsayer board game. Much like its
  predecessor, the contents of this campaign are penned to be diegetic (in-
  universe) artifacts of a world long gone. This means the Zine is written from
  the first-person perspective of a variety of characters rather than presented as
  a module or dissertation. Through this Zine, presented as a "restored" and
  "translated" version of the original tablets, readers will discover a more in-
  depth and personal look at a society that worships the Wind.
  .
  The Zine itself is accompanied by Truth-Tellers, a ruleset for a game children
  would play while living in The Singing Plain. If you are an adult, fear not; the
  game has been played many times with adults of varying maturity levels. It is
  exactly as complex or as simple as the players choose to make it for themselves.
  .
  This Zine (and accompanying small rpg) was originally funded as part of
  Kickstarter's ZineQuest. As such the content is carefully curated to provide
  useful prompts for Game Masters to run games in the setting.
  .
  A breakdown of the files included:
  .
  The Watching Book.pdf: 36 pages of content including a deep-dive into their
  beliefs, information on the culture at large, surrounding worldbuilding,
  dangling mysteries, full-page illustrations, and helpful "author's note" boxes
  .
  Truth-Tellers.pdf: 3 pages of quickly parseable rules for a lighthearted
  mystery-solving rpg
  .
  singing-plain-map.png: the full illustration by Ezra Rose, unbroken by page
  breaks
  .
  This zine is dedicated to my wife, Beckett Rowan, for whom the original
  Soothsayer is also dedicated. My heartfelt thanks to my parents and friends as
  well, as they supported this creation each in their own unique way.

genre: Survival
description:
  Your starship is crashing.
  .
  It's crashing into an uncharted ocean planet on the edge of known space.
  .
  It's OK. This does happen from time to time. As long as you and some of your
  crew get to the Lifeboats in time, you should be able to eject and crash land
  somewhere relatively safely.
  .
  From there, you should be able to scrounge up enough local resources to survive
  at least until rescue can come.
  .
  You should be fine, as long as the Skip Drive Core doesn't breach, local
  wildlife isn't too hostile, and you find sources of food and water...
  .
  ----
  .
  What is This?
  .
  This is a Carta-powered scenario for the Cast Away RPG. To play, you need the
  Cast Away rules, as some of those rules may not be fully explained in this
  supplement. This is designed for play with 1 to 4 players. A Navigator is
  optional, but having someone who has read both books before play is probably
  helpful. This game is designed to simulate sci-fi survival on an uncharted
  planet that is mostly covered in water. It takes inspiration from the Subnautica
  series, No Man's Sky, Oxygen Not Included, and there's a little of Delve and
  Umbra mixed in there.
  .
  ----
  .
  Now With Dracula!
  .
  As part of the Dracula Jam, I added additional rules that brings in vampires.
  Your survivors are now beset by Dracula himself, who is hiding out among the
  crew. Is your crewmate a traitor? Are they a vampire? If you manage to survive,
  are you going to bring vampires back to your home world?
  .
  You're not entirely helpless--your replicator has blueprints to create a weapon
  to fight the vampire: A wooden stake. But, what happens if you attack the wrong
  person?
  .
  Dracula Mode draws inspiration from Among Us, and requires four players.

  Way of the Demon Slayer is a supernatural Chanbara playset for the PARAGON
  system from the AGON roleplaying game. A copy of AGON is required to play. For
  more on the PARAGON system, including how to publish your own playsets, visit
  AGON-RPG.com.
  .
  It is the third year of the Taish era. After a forty years slumber, the father
  of all demons, Onizuka Satzumai ( ), has been seen in Tokyo. Last time he
  awoken, the Shinano river was dyed red by the blood of his victims. The only
  weapons the human have to stop him are the sun... and the Demon Slayers
  .
  You are a Demon Slayer, the last line of defense between humans and demons. The
  Demon Slayers gather their power and endurance from the same blood that flows in
  the demon's veins. The price they pay for this incredible power is a slow
  corruption that inevitably kill them or make them into the very same creatures
  they have sworn to fight: the way of the Demon Slayer is death...
  .
  Way of the Demon Slayer adapts the fast and flexible PARAGON system to a world
  of Yokai and Oni, in pre-WWII Japan. It is heavily inspired by anime like
  Kimetsu no Yaba, Ushio e Tora, Blade of the Immortal and Dororo, and by
  videogames like Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, Ry ga Gotoku Ishin!, Onimusha,
  and Way of the Samurai. This game is in development, but is totally playable in
  its current state. As I add to the game the price may increase.
  .
  The game includes two set of character sheets, in color and greyscale (for
  printing or easier reading). The interactive version of the sheet is made with
  online play in mind (I might make a roll20 sheet after finishing the playtest).

  Now the game also have 2 tracks you probably haven't seen before the Kagura
  (god-entertainment) and the Sin  (Tsumi). The Kagura keeps track of the enemy
  you have encounter. If the Demon Slayers defeat the demon in the final
  confrontation, the can decide if they want to  Purify   (Harae) them or absorb
  the blood to become stronger committing a Sin.
  .
  Rules
  .
  The Slayers
  .
  You start choosing a name and an honorific (-hime, -sama, -san, -chan, -kun,
  -domo, he/she/they/xe, ...). You then give the word to your demon sword and
  choose a fighting/philosophy style.
  .
  Fighting Spirit Element
  .
  Creativity Void
  .
  Evasiveness Wind
  .
  Stability Earth
  .
  Flexibility Water
  .
  Next you choose your favorite fighting spirit from the table (mark 2), and mark
  4 additional fighting spirits of your choice. After you introduce your Slayer to
  the group you need to create the brotherly bonds.
  .
  If your are an Student living in his master dojo  (Uchi-deshi): record 1 bond
  with each other slayer and a bond with your Sensei (worth 1D12).
  .
  If you don't live with your Sensei  (Soto-deshi) or you are self taught: record
  2 bond with each other Slayer.
  .
  Kagura
  .
  The final battle always ends with a confrontation with one of the 9 demons under
  Onizuka. If you best the demon, the leader can decide if they want to purify
  (Harae) the demon or commit a sin (Tsumi) and absorb their blood to become even
  stronger. Each choice has mechanical consequences:
  .
  Harae:  if you decide to purify the demon, the rumor of the great slayers will
  spread among the population ( count it as a great deed that can be replenished
  with a successful Sado check).
  .
  Tsumi:  if you decide to absorb the blood of the demon, you mark one sin on the
  sin track. Every time you mark one of the triangle with an inside triangle, each
  player get a new breathing technique and the demon gain a wrath die.
  .
  Righteous Path
  .
  By following the teaching of one of the 5 masters between missions (see pag.43
  blood offering) or carrying the spirit of their teaching, you can mark one of
  the three petals on their crests. Once a crest is filled, each player get one
  brotherly bond with that master and the group can choose to either:
  .
  Get a new breathing technique, or
  .
  Reduce the Sin tracker by one AND mark the triangular stem on the top of the
  crest.
  .
  Acquiring new breathing techniques
  .
  There are 3 ways to acquire breathing techniques:
  .
  Reaching a full black moon in the demon blood tracker.
  .
  Completing a crest in the righteous path
  .
  Increasing the Sin to a new numbered level.
  .
  If you have completed all breathing techniques, any additional checkmark gives
  you one brotherly bond with a master of your choice and a refresh of 2 spirits
  .
  Note: by marking the stem, you reduce the sin by 1 level instead of getting a
  new breathing technique, this is done on purpose. So if you reduce the Sin below
  a numbered value, you don't lose your breathing technique and the next time you
  in increase your Sin you get an additional breathing technique.
  .
  Demon Blood
  .
  The demon blood is the most powerful weapon in the Demon Slayer arsenal. At any
  time, the Slayer can substitute a Body or Spirit point for a Demon Blood one
  (for example if you don't have enough to fight an Akuma or an Onry or if a
  particular form of Spirit is required.

  What is Wayfarer's Deck?
  .
  This series of 50-card decks with encounters, wonders, mysteries, puzzles, and
  findings provides a convenient way of creating engaging situations for the
  players. Instead of rolling for random encounters, pick a card (or draw one at
  random, or roll a d100 and divide the result by two - whatever sounds like fun
  for you) and let yourself be inspired.
  .
  The cards introduce a variety of encounters and don't dictate the solutions.
  You're never forced to fight whatever you've found, and the player have a full
  agency to do whatever they wish. There are no stat blocks and no answers to the
  mysteries - you're free to take the situation wherever the inspiration takes
  you.
  .
  The cards are setting-agnostic and compatible with any fantasy game, solo or in
  a party play, with or without a game master.
  .
  In the bowels of the Earth
  .
  You've been following this tunnel for some time - ten minutes, perhaps? It
  should lead you to the vertical shaft and the lift, your closest way out of this
  maze-like abandoned mine. Your light source is dimming with each passing minute,
  and you can feel the pangs of pain in your ankle after your last tumble in the
  near-absolute darkness. You gather your willpower and take a deep breath,
  staring at the two identical passages in front of you. The corridor splits here,
  and you find yourself at the crossroads...
  .
  Wayfarer's Deck: Depths of the Earth invites you to venture deep into mines,
  caves, tunnels, burrows, and dungeons. Discover fabulous treasure, encounter
  other travelers and suspicious cracks in the ceiling, get uncomfortably lost,
  find traps (hopefully not too late!), and explore the marvelous and dangerous
  underworld.

  coded messages sent through the mail.  You and your partner both covet the
  Prize, which you believe will transform your lives for the better. But acquiring
  it is an extremely tricky operation. Many things stand in your way, including
  the Target.
  .
  Created for the #SaveThe Post jam by Ken Davidson.
  .
  Artwork by me (J. Gurantz).
  .
  This game includes:
  .
  Six detailed letter descriptions (see photo below). Each with different writing
  prompts and with a micro-mission for both players.
  .
  A link to two google docs  that contain encryption techniques, online resources,
  and ideas for mail art (ways to decorate your correspondence).
  .
  A mini-glossary of spy terms.
  .
  A brief section on how to play this online (as a variation).
  .
  Together all 6 letter exchanges can lead to a unified story arc.
  .
  Inspiration:
  .
  This game was inspired by my love for letter writing and mail art. Our personal
  letters carry with them our feelings and thoughts. May We Are Ciphers entice
  people to send cool things through the mail.   Also, may this and other games in
  the jam help give the USPS and other postal systems visibility.
  .
  O sige! See you in the mail,

  It's not what you say, it's how you say it. We should talk is a short-form
  narrative game that will make you think carefully about the words you choose,
  coming Thursday July 16th 2020 to Windows, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Linux,
  and Nintendo Switch.
  .
  In We should talk, you'll use the sentence spinner to piece together modular
  sentences in response to the in-game characters. Choose your words carefully to
  express yourself as you discuss ongoing problems about life and romance with
  Sam, your in-game partner, over text messages, while also chatting with friends
  and strangers at your favorite local bar.
  .
  The combination of words you choose impacts the conversations you have, how
  genuinely you can connect with your partner, and whether your relationship can
  survive the night. It's up to you how you respond-depending on how you
  communicate, you'll see one of many possible endings.
  .
  Personalized Choices: Using the sentence spinner, make choices that connect with
  you. Countless options abound-be yourself, or role play someone you never
  thought you could be.
  .
  Unique Characters: Your night at the bar is more interesting thanks to all the
  unique people you encounter. Find your healthy balance between chatting with
  your friends and keeping up with the texts from your partner at home.
  .
  Different Paths: Your choices drastically affect the way folks respond to you,
  leading to one of many different paths in each conversation. Will you be
  accommodating, flirty, stand-offish, or somewhere in-between?
  .
  Multiple endings: Play again and again to find all 9 possible endings.
  Conclusions aren't based on a specific path or route the way many traditional
  narrative games branch, but instead the endings are based on the tone your
  responses express throughout the game. What do your relationships look like at
  the end of the night?
  .
  Realistic conversations: Experience the emotions that come with real
  conversations, whether it's the the joy that comes with teasing a friend, the
  anxiety that comes with a heavy text message, or the frustration of navigating a
  touchy conversation with a creep. Express yourself as clearly as you can and
  hope that your conversational partner understands, though there's always a risk
  they might interpret your words differently than you intended.

  We Used to Be Friends is a collaborative teenage detective drama game. As a
  group, you'll create your teenagers, the city they live in, and a season-long
  mystery that ties them all together.
  .
  We Used to Be Friends involves a series of interwoven mysteries. You'll have
  your season mystery, every character has their own personal mystery, and each
  session has its own episode mystery. Since the game is collaborative, you'll
  investigate locations to find clues and then apply those clues to the various
  mysteries, moving them along as you discover what happens together. No one needs
  to plan it out before you play. You can pick up the game and immediately begin
  to figure out who did it.
  .
  While the mysteries are going on, the characters still live their lives. They
  have friends, enemies, acquaintances who are all around them. They open up to
  each other, they fight over their feelings, and get into trouble while figuring
  out what happened. Part of the essential conflict and drama of We Used to Be
  Friends is balancing the tension of the mysteries with the reality that these
  characters all have to live in the same town.

developer: Triple Topping
publisher: Triple Topping
genre: Adventure
description:
  Welcome to Elk is a biographical adventure set on an island like no other, where
  every character you encounter has a story to tell. From the weird and wonderful
  to the dark and desperate, all the tales told on Elk are based on true stories
  of life on the road less traveled.
  .
  Tales of real stories
  .
  Welcome to Elk, an adventure game set on a fictional island stitched together
  with true stories and tall tales, and inhabited by the people who lived them.
  .
  Story
  .
  You play as Frigg, a young carpenter trading their busy life in the city for an
  apprenticeship in a small town. When she arrives in Elk, Frigg worries that the
  slower pace of life will be boring (they don't even have the internet), but
  quickly discovers nothing could be further from the truth!
  .
  Tragic stories told with love and sometimes humour
  .
  The stories reflect the drama of our lives, on Elk it's known that humour, love
  and death go hand in hand. Life may seem hard sometimes, but it is always
  followed by laughter.
  .
  Make new friends
  .
  On Elk, you will meet weird and wonderful characters - people whom the world has
  either ignored or forgotten. Follow their ups and downs, their odd drinking
  rituals and their unique ways of tackling whatever life throws at them.
  .
  Unique mini games
  .
  Help your new friends on Elk through playful mini games. All games are uniquely
  tailored to underline the story and the mood of the game.
  .
  Meet the people who told the original stories
  .
  We value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and
  share them. That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who
  inspired us to make this game.
  .
  How we used true stories in the game?
  .
  True stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have
  dealt with it in Welcome to Elk:
  .
  The stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were
  there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are
  used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but
  everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and
  often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them
  tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true
  crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative.
  Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of
  originally and only us who designed it will ever know - or come close to the
  real truth of the stories.
  .
  Welcome to Elk might look like a "fun" game but it's about telling stories -
  some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand.

  Looking for a haunted house with a difference?
  .
  Everyone knows the abandoned house at the edge of town is to be avoided. Which
  is why a group of teens are going to party it up inside. They aren't alone
  though  and someone or something is waiting for them. The teens don't see the
  warning signs, the faint light flickering in the windows, nor the moving
  shadows. Your hunters do though and it's up to them to protect some teens and
  kick(ing) some ghost butt!
  .
  This is a slightly unorthodox haunted house mystery. It contains a variety of
  ghosts, as well as innocent bystanders (ghost fodder), a monster's backstory and
  a touch of 80s flare to keep things fun.
  .
  The author has also included a few suggestions on how to make your mystery more
  comedic or scary.
  .
  Made for use with the Monster of the Week RPG by Michael Sands.

  Submission for Libre Baskerville Jam by Jared Sinclair.

  "What a harrowing game. I think the scariest thing about it, for me, is the
  nebulous space it leaves between reality and fiction. We're meant to "draw from"
  our real lives, but this is still a roleplaying game, and we're still
  establishing a shared fiction together (at least, the way I read the game). So
  there's this uncertainty behind every statement: Are we airing real grievances?
  Are we exaggerating otherwise insignificant grievances? Are we inventing ones
  that are merely plausible (and is that inherently a kind of judgment or
  indictment)?" - Jared Sinclair

  It's been a year since Survey Team 4 landed on Osiris 4. They reported a
  peaceful planet with the highest density of life signs ever detected. And then
  .... nothing. No response to communications, no emergency beacons, nothing at
  all. What happened to them?
  .
  What happened to Survey Team 4? is the third chapter in my One day at a time
  series. The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple
  games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:
  .
  I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.
  .
  No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.
  .
  Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.
  .
  All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.
  .
  With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I
  decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order.
  What happened to Survey Team 4? is based on the 2011 theme of "extinction".

  2 six-sided dice each (4 would be better),
  .
  3 to 6 people to play,
  .
  one of those people will be the Game master (GM),
  .
  pencils,
  .
  paper,
  .
  and around two hours.
  .
  Why does this exist?
  .
  My players were going to attack another temple and wipe out all the zombie's
  inside and take the relics and desecrate the sacred place, again. We all knew
  they were going to succeed. I figured, why not play it from the perspective of
  the zombies and see if they can still do it.
  .
  I wanted a super simple rule system and WSCA fitted perfectly. In fact, I wrote
  this during the WSCA Jam last year but didn't get around to finishing it. And
  then I read Mrk Borg, which has clearly had an impact on my aesthetic choices.
  .
  When would I play this?
  .
  Play this when you need a break from your regular game. Play this to populate a
  temple for your regular game. Play this when you want to find out how the
  zombies feel about having their idols stolen. Play this to help your players
  branch out from their safety RPGs. Play this when you want to design a nasty god
  and the temple their worshipers live in.

  Milky Way Prince - The Vampire Star by Santa Ragione
  .
  Wheels of Aurelia is a narrative road trip game set in the roaring Italian 70s.
  Half racing game, half interactive fiction, it tells the story of Lella, a
  restless woman driving on the roads of the western coast of Italy, the famous
  Via Aurelia.
  .
  Wheels of Aurelia plays like an old-school isometric arcade racer, except that
  you get to chat with your passenger while driving. The story takes places at the
  end of the 70s - a time of terrorism, kidnappings, and political turmoil in
  Italy - and it will introduce you to that world and its dynamics thorough a cast
  of characters that you have never met in a video game. It's up to you to
  discover their motivations for driving along the coast of Italy and away from
  their homes.
  .
  Based on your choices - and the places you'll decide to visit - you may end up
  in car chases, illegal street races, or in tense debates that will make you
  wonder who your travel companions really are.
  .

description:
  You live in the dark.
  .
  No one knows why the lights of the world went out. Why the sun suddenly flared
  up, scorched the Earth in a split-second incandescent flash, then faded. Why it
  became a dull orange-red color, cool and distant, and only just warming the
  planet. Only just holding back an eternal, icy night.
  .
  No one knows why power stopped. Why the cities went black when the sun faded. If
  it was the solar flare that did it, or if electricity had simply fallen to
  whatever had dimmed the sun. No one knows why it all went away.
  .
  But it did.
  .
  You live in the dark.
  .
  It's been 50 years since the Flare. Your community can take care of itself now.
  Maybe it pulled itself out of the ashes and ruin that came in the wake of
  everything changing. Or maybe it was built on top of the rubble of older cities,
  older communities, that turned and ate themselves when the sun rose different.
  Either way, life will out, and people will find a way to survive.
  .
  So you live on an island in the sea of a dark country, knowing only the people
  of your community, and the stories of the few travellers who brave the
  blackness. Your world is only as large as the walls of the community.
  .
  You live in the dark.
  .
  Or you did, until the computer came to life.
  .
  Until it whirred, and clicked, and found power where none had been.
  .
  Until the screen blinked on, and bright while words began to print themselves
  across it.
  .
  You were alone, until messages began.
  .
  -----
  .
  When the Messages Began is a 2-player role playing game of digital exchanges.
  .
  The Receiver is a member of a functioning community built in the ruins of the
  post-Flare world.
  .
  The Sender is a string of words appearing on the screen of a long-dead computer.
  .
  Receiver and Sender, knowing each other only through what they write,
  communicate in the hopes of learning who exactly the other is, and how they can
  be used to further their own goals.

publisher: bartbonte
genre: Action;Playground
description:
  'Where is cat?', created for the #oujevipo4kids contest, a game jam for games
  targeted to young kids (6 and older).
  .
  Since one of the possible constraints of the jam was that the game should be
  partly made by one or several children, I proposed to my own kids (aged 5, 8 and
  10) to make a game together and they immediately loved the idea.
  .
  We sat together for a brainstorm and also choose the 'playground' constraint,
  meaning the game should be inspired by a traditional children's game and we
  picked 'hide-and-seek'.
  .
  So the concept for the game and the story comes from the children, but they also
  drew a lot of the individual graphics: a lot of the object that are in the rooms
  were drawn by them and then imported, processed, colored and combined on the pc.
  They also made the artworks that were scanned and are on the walls in the game.
  .
  So I hope you enjoy this Bonte family creation. The children are very proud of
  their creation :) Making a game with your kids is fun!

  Come and relax with a hot and steamy coffee! In a town where adult entertainment
  is the new best thing, the Whipped and Steamy Caf is the best fun for all
  cosplayers with a wild and adventurous side! No shirts, no shoes, no shame and
  only the best service!
  .
  But this caf needs an extra pair of hands to stay steamy. Fortunately, our brand
  new hire Caffie just got the job! With a stoic demeanour and an utter lack of
  interest for the job, she'll have to manage the plans and decorations of the
  everyday, and meet up with the clientele. And, who knows? Maybe even make some
  unlikely friends...
  .
  Enough about that. Fire up for an experience that only a cosplay caf can
  provide! Here's hoping your time at the caf is just like we like our coffee:
  Hot, steamy, and with skimpy clothing!

  Select the coffee of the day, the snacks, and the decoration to appeal to
  different groups of cosplayers! Plan to increase group interest, tips, and come
  up with your own strategies!
  .
  Try to juggle between keeping them all happy, or see if appealing to some is
  more profitable!
  .
  6 cosplayers to meet! Try to appeal to their sense of decoration and you might
  see them more than a few times. And maybe even see more of them, if you know

developer: Owl Knight Games, by Jennifer Adcock
publisher: Owl Knight Games, by Jennifer Adcock
genre: Role Playing
description:
  The Thousand Moons is a fragmented region in the furthest reaches of outer
  space. The name is misleading - there are perhaps hundreds of thousands of Moons
  here, maybe millions, each one tiny and unique. A perpetual gravity storm rages
  around this astral archipelago, making entry into the Thousand Moons - or exit
  from them - quite difficult.
  .
  No Moon in the Thousand Moons is bigger than a speck of dust, in the scheme of
  things. Each one can accommodate only a few people for any length of time, so
  the few beings - humans and aliens alike - who eke out their livings here tend
  towards transiency. The Thousand Moons are safe, and they are quiet, though they
  are far from perfect.
  .
  You are a Seneschal of the Thousand Moons. You have been tasked with the care
  and protection of the Moons - as many as you may visit in what time you have.
  You stay around two weeks on each Moon you visit, to learn and explore and solve
  any problems you may encounter. No two Moons are the same, flung here in pieces
  from disparate galaxies, so there is a great deal to learn and explore.
  .
  All Seneschals keep journals, and often leave them behind as a gift to future
  Seneschals who may arrive on the same Moon. It is exceedingly rare to meet
  another Seneschal face-to-face - there are so few of you and space is so large -
  but there is a vast network of you, connected across time and space only by each
  other's journals.
  .
  ---
  .
  This is a storytelling game, where you will write the journal of a Seneschal on
  a new Moon, using randomized word prompts, like Magnetic Poetry, a commercially
  available set of poetic words printed on refrigerator magnets.

  Materials: A deck of playing cards and a handful of 6-sided dice. Optional:
  Printouts of the cards (cut out) and card sleeves
  .
  About: A solo cafe simulator brought to the table with dice and cards. Customers
  may not always get the drink they want, but they'll always get what they need.
  .
  Thank you for joining us at Whistling Wolf Cafe! Our motto is "You might not
  always get what you want, but you'll always get what you need." As you can
  imagine, serving customers by giving them what they need to feel better instead
  of what they prefer can be tricky, but I trust that your amazing tea-brewing
  skills and customer service will win them over. We average three customers an
  hour, so you'll have breaks in between.
  .
  Oh! Before I forget, there's a small shop right next door with things that could
  help you out. Sometimes there are even people looking for a bit of work. Just be
  sure you use your own tips to purchase them or the owner will be, well, not so
  happy. Also, I hate to say it, but if you get three bad reviews, it's really not
  going to look good for either of us. So do what you can to avoid that.
  .
  Whistling Wolf Cafe is a solo cafe sim game that takes 10-20 minutes to play.
  You are a master brewer who is more focused on what a customer might need rather
  than what they want, and that can complicate things. All you need is a deck of
  playing cards, a handful of six-sided dice, and something to take notes with.
  .
  A very special thank you to Antonio for writing a Spanish translation of this
  game! He not only translated it, but took the time to fix any potential cultural
  gaps for anyone outside of the US! Please be sure to visit Cafe El lobo
  aullador!

  you, more community copies were added!

  This is a game where two players recreate the folkloric story of Shamhat and
  Enkidu. It is a game of power, consent, knowledge, loyalty, and love. It uses a
  deck of cards to help narration.
  .
  The Myth
  .
  In the old story, Enkidu is a wild man who has been freeing animals from traps
  set by hunters, destroying cattle pens, and leading wild animals close to
  civilization. He must be tamed in order to protect the people living in the
  valley. King Gilgamesh, a warlord, hearing these things, sends Shamhat, the
  sacred prostitute to tame the wild man. Shamhat and Enkidu spend two weeks
  together in the wilderness. When Shamhat returns, she relates to Gilgamesh that
  the wild man Enkidu has been tamed, and then returns to him, forsaking her life
  at the temple and living with Enkidu as a wife.
  .
  The Game
  .
  In the game one person will play Shamhat - the sacred prostitute, and the other
  will play Enkidu, the wildling. The game takes place over a series of
  interactions where Shmahat attempts to seduce Enkidu to lie with them. In doing
  so, politics and power will be revealed, and both characters will have to
  consent and understand what will happen if they do lie together. Underneath all
  this lies the simple fact: Shamhat and Enkidu are attracted to each other, in a
  way that neither of them can fully explain.

description:
  You are Sprocket, an adorable ferret who knocks things over and steals junk on a
  space station in the far future! Escape your playpen and make your way to the
  shuttlebay with the most stuff!
  .
  Widget Satchel is a daunting adventure for one little thief, with fiendish
  puzzles and tricky platforming, but don't worry: You may lose some Widgets (or
  your socks!) along the way, but Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no "game
  over." Of course, it will take all of your ferret-y determination if you hope to
  stash away every Widget, discover every Trinket, and try on every pair of Socks!
  .
  Widgets: you want them! But beware, every widget you put in your satchel makes
  it heavier, making it a little bit harder to jump to the next platform or
  scramble past the station's maintenance bots. Levels can be relatively easy if
  you don't collect any Widgets, but they become a greater challenge as you fill
  Sprocket's satchel.
  .
  You'll reach special Fabricator rooms in each level, where you can exchange your
  Widgets for power-ups called Doohickeys. Bots giving you trouble? Equip yourself
  with The Wrench and show them what's what. Widget out of reach? Put on Jef's
  Boots and get up there! There are five Doohickeys to help you on your adventure,
  and you can build them in any order, so you can play the game (and discover its
  secrets) however you like.
  .
  High scores, hidden collectables, and secret paths are great, sure, but in
  Widget Satchel you can also just knock stuff over and get into trouble if you
  prefer! And the more mischief you do, the more mischief points you'll earn! What
  are mischief points? It's not important, but there are an awful lot of them!
  .
  Original soundtrack that dynamically reacts to your progress.
  .
  Replayable areas with "metroidvania-lite" pathing.
  .
  Sock-exclusive inventory system.
  .
  Trapdoors, lifts, hydraulic pillars, and other nonsense machinery to manipulate.
  .

genre: Role Playing

  Game Overview
  .
  The Wind Began to Howl is a song fiction tabletop role-playing game that brings
  2-3 players together with the iconic ballad All Along the Watchtower to create
  stories of intimate conspiracy and desperate adventure.
  .
  Each two to three-hour session offers a zero-prep one shot experience built
  around the popular Forged in the Dark action role playing game system, easy to
  fit into busy schedules or between sessions of longer-form RPGs.
  .
  Two players take up the roles of the Joker and the Thief from the song lyrics,
  while an optional third player can join in to help facilitate the game by
  referencing the rules and playing other characters in the world.
  .
  Play is guided by listening to the four verses of the song, with the first three
  verses setting up the conspiracy of the Joker and the Thief, and the final verse
  playing out their assault on the Watchtower. Each verse is accompanied by rules
  and establishing questions that work with the lyrics to build a vivid game
  world.
  .
  The final verse plays much like a fast-paced score from Blades in the Dark, and
  the results decide the apocalyptic fate of the conspirators, the Watchtower, and
  the world that surrounds them.
  .
  The Song
  .
  Ominous and conspiratorial, Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower is one of the
  most iconic ballads of the 20th century, and has continued to inspire covers,
  adaptations, and new creations ever since its first release in 1967. Watchtower
  has become emblematic of the tumultuous years of the Vietnam War, and has hardly
  lost its relevance in the new millennium. From Battlestar Galactica, to
  Watchmen, to Sons of Anarchy, fiction continues to reference the music and
  lyrics in a way that defies the restrictions of genre and setting. Each
  generation and individual find their own connection with the work and give it a
  unique expression of their own.
  .
  The Wind Began to Howl is a catalyst for these connections, allowing players to
  interpret the enigmatic and evocative lyrics on their own terms and see them
  come to life. Playtests have produced stories as diverse as royal court
  conspiracies and cyber thrillers about hacking into the systems of corrupt
  financiers. Each session opens the possibility of the music leading you
  somewhere new.
  .
  The Characters
  .
  The Joker
  .
  "There must be some way out of here"
  .
  Wealthy and connected, the Joker is a creature of comfortable malaise. They are
  shaken out of their listless condition by the Thief and use their resources to
  overcome the Watchtower and its defenders.
  .
  The Thief
  .
  "Let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late"
  .
  Cunning and decisive, the Thief defines themselves through action. They rely
  upon their resolve in the face of adversity and challenge.
  .
  The Goods
  .
  The Wind Began to Howl 21 page 8.5 x 11" full color PDF, with illustrations and
  layout by artist Lu Quade (Including printer friendly PDF).
  .
  A bespoke cover single of All Along the Watchtower, created by Lu Quade to

  It is the beginning of Spring in the small village of Dunfel.
  .
  You are Vyler, a young man that's lived in these parts all your life.
  .
  You've been learning from nature and have stumbled upon some bit of magic here
  and there, but you've never had any formal training. Fashioning yourself out to
  be a druid, or at least what you think one should be like, based on what you've
  read, you feel a closeness to the earth.
  .
  On the first full moon of Spring, you were visited by a woman, or rather her
  spirit, as she came to you using great powers you had never seen before. You are
  awestruck, seeing her appear out of the air, with her eyes glowing like embers.
  .
  She motions for you to come sit next to her, as she formally greets you. Calling
  herself Eraina, she tells you that she is in need of someone worthy enough to be
  her apprentice. Looking through all of the region, you were the only person she
  felt would qualify for what she deemed an important role. You would be her
  apprentice, if you chose to accept the offer. Agreeing, you set out the next
  day, following the path in the nearby woods that Eraina had directed you to.
  .
  Thus begins your journey to meet the mystic Eraina and find your calling.
  .
  The Winding Journey is a game made for the Carta jam.
  .
  For it, you will need-
  .
  A standard deck of playing cards, with two jokers.
  .
  Two six-sided dice.
  .
  A marker, or token, to track your movement.
  .
  A journal, or some paper, to write on.
  .
  Enough room to lay out a 4x6 grid of cards.

description:
  Windstone is a single player survival exploration game where the survival
  mechanics are the core and supply management can mean the difference between
  life and death.
  .
  Hunt and forage for food, craft tools and weapons and explore an inhospitable
  land as you and your dragon strive to bring an end to the Formicans who have
  invaded your colony planet.
  .
  Windstone is set in a vast seamless open world. Tutorial objectives and quests
  initially guide you to help you get the hang of things.
  .
  Survival Mechanics:
  .
  In addition to survival mechanics such as hunger, thirst, body temperature,
  stamina, endurance and overall health you also must manage your mental fortitude
  and nutrition as well as the needs of your dragon.
  .
  Many unique items from basic stone tools to obsidian weapons and carapace armor
  are essential for survival in WINDSTONE.
  .
  Claim an abandoned cabin as your home or wander the lands as a nomad.
  .
  Enemies and Wildlife:

  and their queen to make the alien colony world safe for repopulation.
  .
  Hunt Antelope, wolves, the raptor-like Ostri and the lumbering Tardigrade.

  Witchball is a post-reality racing game played by children in the year 2601.
  .
  Massive environmental change has made much of the world inaccessible, and long-
  distance travel impossible. Communities are isolated, but communication has
  advanced to the point where short distances between people barely exist at all.
  .
  In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously
  playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained
  in both aspects and tallied per lap, so it's important -- and tricky -- to
  manage the space better than the opponent.

  Originally used for fishing, glass buoys became associated with witches during
  witch-hunts in the late 1600s. Traditionally, a 'witch ball' is a glass orb hung
  in a home to ward away bad or evil spirits. The act of play, and games by
  extension, can function in a similar way -- kind of like a respite from the
  darkness. Games won't solve any problems, and neither will a ward, but
  safeguards and rest are necessary parts of life and games can provide that. A
  game as a ward, not an escape.

description:
  The Wizard is just that. He wears a pointed hat. Never refer to him as anything
  else, through description, NPC dialogue, etc. He is the truth.
  .
  In the tranquil hamlet of Canny, there's a bounty out on a wizard. Allegedly, he
  wreaked some havoc before escaping to his Tower on the Hill to the north. As the
  characters discover the carnage he left behind and begin to explore his sinister
  lair, it becomes increasingly clear that whatever they're dealing with is
  definitely not a wizard- but he's somehow convinced everybody else that he is.
  .
  A WIZARD is an eldritch horror tabletop game module for OSR systems. The
  characters ascend the Tower on the Hill, trying to survive in the face of a
  truly outlandish, capricious threat, and possibly stop it.

  Winner of the Human Human Machine award at A MAZE 2017!
  .
  Word After Word is a fast-paced local multiplayer word game that uses a massive
  natural language dataset to reward players for thinking naturally about common
  word usage and context. The game is played by two to four people, each with
  their own keyboard. Each player is given the same randomly generated series of
  adjectives one at a time. For each adjective, each player tries to identify the
  noun that most commonly follows it (e.g. fast CAR). Each player is given a score
  based on how often their noun follows the given adjective in a dataset compiled
  from over a half a billion words taken from magazines, tv, and books. For each
  prompt, there are potentially thousands of correct answers of varying degrees.
  As an example, let's say players were given the word "traditional." In the
  dataset, there are approximately 2000 nouns that would be accepted and scored.
  High scoring answers would be: role, family, and music.
  .
  Note: you need to plug multiple keyboards into the same computer to play.

  1.1c patch notes:
  .
  Added back misplaced ending music intro (it used to be just the loop part of the
  track playing)
  .
  Made it possible to start the game without using openGL at all, see instructions
  above in the "The game doesn't run" section.
  .
  1.1b patch notes:
  .
  Fixed crash on using the smithy.
  .
  1.1 patch notes:
  .
  Fixed a bug where the orb could be mixed up with an item upon entering the
  throne room, enabling a premature win.
  .
  Ninjas and ghosts can now properly interact with special tiles in rooms.
  .
  Ninjas and ghosts have been forbidden to forge pickaxes, as that would be
  problematic.
  .
  Goblins' tiles and items brought to school will no longer be confiscated upon
  graduation.
  .
  The goblin tamer formation now includes a task separation course teaching them
  not to call the wolves when dropping an item.
  .
  Stopped wandering entities to pile up on tiles where there are already two other
  entities, which would push the oldest entity on that square into a frightening
  liminal space between states of being where they would be drawn but never again
  updated. (similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis if you will)
  .
  Swap control prompts will now go away if you ignore them for long enough and use
  the other swap controls instead.
  .
  Made it impossible for room descriptions to be partially off-screen.
  .
  Giving up in expansion mode will now trigger the score counting sequence.
  .
  Added back misplaced description for the vampire: they do steal enemy HPs.
  .
  Now displaying difficulty and how many in-game years it took to win the run in
  the ending screen.
  .
  You can now fast-forward through the ending screen with the action key.
  .
  Corrected a few typos.
  .
  Default window size is now smaller.
  .
  Shader can now properly be deactivated from the options. (no visual difference
  but may affect performences either way depending on your setup - in doubt, we
  recommend leaving it on)

  PREPARE YOURSELF!
  .
  Get ready to gorge on a four-course-meal of intense arcade action! WretchWorks
  presents the inaugural Arcade Pack; an homage to the golden age of arcade games!
  4 challenging treats for one low price.
  .
  These experiments in coin-op sensibilities all share the same ingredients, but
  are distinguished with a unique flavor and attitude. Here's what you can expect
  from each:
  .
  High-octane arena action! Try your best to survive against the endless
  onslaughts of mutants, aliens, and otherworldly beings!
  .
  Numbers (they go up)! Be it score, time, or combos, there's always a higher
  score to chase. Demise and triumph await!
  .
  Bizarre sights and sounds! Squishy bacteria, howling spirits, and chattering
  firearms set an appropriate tone for each of these arcade adventures!
  .
  MEET THE GAMES
  .
  Really Unique Space Shooter - Caught alone in a remote corner of the galaxy;
  help Captain Scott fend-off hostile alien forces as you collect new weapons and
  build as high a combo as you possibly can!
  .
  Cylor vs. The Endless Legions - Hungry for revenge, Cylor plunges deep into the
  heart of the Mutant Cat stronghold to end things once and for all. . . or at
  least die trying. How long can he survive?
  .
  Bullet Cell - White blood cells never have it easy; not when their health and
  ammo are one and the same! Defend the body from invading pathogens and enjoy
  surreal sounds as you budget your plasma to the very last drop.
  .
  Star Phantom - Battle space-faring ghosts in this 'inverted take' on an arcade
  classic. Ram into asteroids and harvest their chunks before the Phantoms can,
  and pray they don't try you as their next meal instead.
  .
  We hope you find these offerings both appetizing and entertaining! Be sure to
  hone those skills, because some day soon you may just see these devilish treats
  resurface outside the bounds of this collection.
  .
  IMPORTANT
  .
  This release is Windows-only for the time being.  Feel free to let us know if
  you would like us to bring this collection to Mac, Linux, or any other potential

game: Wretched Wasteland (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/Itchio/W/Wretched Wasteland (USA)/Wretched Wasteland (USA).json
developer: Largshire Press
publisher: Largshire Press
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Wretched Wasteland is a game about survival. Survival in a world torn apart by
  war. It is a game about the few people that still inhabit the Earth and the
  dangers they face.
  .
  Your character is a scout from The Compound, a small bastion of civilisation. As
  a scout, you have seen what the wasteland has done to people. How it has
  infected their minds and turned them into murderers, thieves, and cannibals. You
  know what horrors exist out in the wastes.
  .
  A scout knows that patience and a slow pace are key to survival. However, you
  must move at a dangerous speed to make it back in time. They also know that the
  wastes take a heavy toll on the mind and the body...
  .
  Traverse the wasteland and try to survive. That is your job.
  .
  There is only one way to win, and many ways to die.
  .
  Content Warning
  .
  While this game is for fun it does deal with some dark themes. It contains
  violence, death, starvation, rabid dogs, and cannibalism. It is about surviving
  in a horrible post apocalyptic future. It is unlikely you will not be successful
  with your journey, without lightly modifying the rules. But this game is about
  the narrative that a scout in the wastes experiences however, it is not all doom
  and gloom. There are little gems of beauty in the wasteland. If you pull a card
  that doesn't fit well with you, that's fine. Just skip it.
  .
  What do you need?
  .
  To play you'll need a standard deck of cards with no jokers, a single 6-sided
  die, a tumbling block tower, and token of some kind to mark your progress on the
  map. You will also need some way to record your journey, a book, microphone, or
  a camera.
  .
  This game is based on the Wretched & Alone system, and was made for the Wretched
  & Alone Jam! It takes inspiration from video games Fallout 1 & Fallout 2 by
  Interplay, the music of The Goondock Saint & Mark Morgan, and books The Postman
  by David Brin, Earth Abides by George R. Stewart, and The Gunslinger by Stephen
  King.
  .
  The revised and reprinted edition of this game exists because of the generosity
  of our Kickstarter supporters.

  Final report, the commercial star-ship Nostromo. Third officer reporting. The
  other members of the crew-Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash, and Captain Dallas-
  are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier within six
  weeks. With a little luck the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last
  survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.

  The Wretched is a solo journaling RPG played with a deck of cards, a tumbling
  block tower, and a microphone.
  .
  You are the last surviving crew member of the intergalactic salvage ship The
  Wretched. Adrift between stars after an engine failure, your ship was attacked
  by a hostile alien lifeform. The crew are dead.
  .
  You thought you had won. You launched the creature out of an airlock, and that
  should have meant safety.
  .
  It didn't.
  .
  < - - - >
  .
  The Wretched is a game about human resilience in the face of overwhelming odds
  and almost certain death. It is a game about isolation, fear, and perseverance.
  .
  You play a lone survivor of an horrific attack. You have seen and done terrible
  things, you have seen your friends - your found family - brutally butchered by
  something you can't even begin to comprehend, something that you were sure
  didn't exist until it manifested itself aboard your ship.
  .
  You are existing on the edges of your endurance, high on adrenaline and fear and
  desperation. You are sure you won't survive this, but all you know to do is to
  keep fighting.
  .
  The Wretched is inspired by the music of John Carpenter and Nine Inch Nails, as
  well as You Are Not Alone In This Life and you will die alone out here in the
  black by Rufus Roswell.
  .

  The Wretched  comes with a unique soundtrack written and recorded specifically
  for this game, plus an expanded soundtrack produced as part of the Kickstarter
  campaign. You can listen to a sample of the soundtrack below.

developer: WuDeRPG
publisher: WuDeRPG
genre: Role Playing
description:
  (Wu De) - The Five Powers is a narrative RPG - a Shared Narrative. It is setting
  agnostic, which means it you can play  - The Five Powers in any setting you
  choose. Creating your own setting is part of setting up your unique game
  experience.
  .
  - The Five Powers is like the Base Game/SRD of the Element Dice System. It is a
  toolbox for your own creations!
  .
  - The Five Powers is powered by the Element Dice System, a system based on the
  east-asian philosophy of Yin & Yang and the 5 Powers, or Elements.
  .
  The game requires only 6 d6 in two different colors (3 white dice, 3 black dice
  - or any 2 colors you choose). But you can easily create your own Element Dice
  with some creativity.
  .
  You can find the full game here!
  .
  Use WuDe as an SRD
  .
  The game mechanics in WuDe - The Five Powers are a basic game experience you can
  easily hack. There is already a whole group of games from two game jams that
  show how versatile the Element Dice System is.
  .

  the following form - and drop us a message on Twitter @wuderpg, so we can cheer
  you on:

  Element Dice Games:
  .
  There are already too many Element Dice games to give a shout-out to all of
  them, but we want to highlight some that are exceptional or currently
  itchfunding:
  .
  Clean-Up Crew
  .
  Clean-Up Crew is currently itchfunding for artwork from a diverse team of 6
  artists from around the world and with representation from the LGBTQ+ community.
  Clean-Up Crew is a fast paced power fantasy, illuminated by LUMEN. You play
  Cleaners that get called to clean up Messy Cases for Soul Detectives, and that
  means one thing and one thing alone: Kick serious Monster Ass!
  .
  Mariann: Soul Detective
  .
  Mariann: Soul Detective is the dark and somber counterpart to Clean-Up Crew.
  Mariann is a quiet game for two that takes you through the transformation from a
  gifted young person to a Soul Detective - equipped with magic powered by the 5
  Elements!
  .
  The Moment You Were Born
  .
  The Moment You Were Born is probably the most unique experience you will come
  across here on itch - so exceptional, that we didn't call it a game to avoid any
  misunderstandings. But it still takes the Element Dice System and uses it in an
  extraordinary way.
  .
  An Affair of Honor
  .
  An Affair of Honor is the proof that itchfunding works! Funded in under 5
  minutes - An Affair of Honor delivers fun in a way you never used Domino tiles
  before!
  .
  Sacred Forge
  .
  Sacred Forge by the talented Cat of Peach Garden Games is currently itchfunding
  to support the Actual Play Podcast Roar To Heaven of their LUMEN game Blazing
  Hymn - everything excellent!
  .
  Sageuk! - Roleplay in Joseon
  .
  Sageuk! - Roleplay in Joseon by Hessan Yongdi showcases the 5 Elements in a
  historical Korean setting and provides great guidance on how to use regular d6
  with the Element Dice System.

  The power of Xenonature..
  .
  In the future year of 2011, Zeta Reak, kind, gentle king of the Xenolians, is
  overthrown by a powerful tyrant named the "Xenogunner".
  .
  The Xenogunner is a mysterious being capable of many frightening feats, using a
  power known as "Xenonature", a powerful energy that grants one trained in the
  use of it many elemental and non-elemental powers.
  .
  Zeta, too, is gifted with the powers of Xenonature. It's up to Zeta to overthrow
  the Xenogunner and reclaim the throne...
  .
  ...but is the Xenogunner actually the one pulling the strings...?
  .
  Intense Boss Battles!
  .
  Xenogunner is an intense boss-focused run-and-gun platformer based on games from
  the days of 16-bit consoles. With the addition of conveniences like mouse aiming
  and highly customizable difficulty settings, we believe that we've truly
  modernized a classic game genre that started in decades long since past.
  .
  The stages are short, the bosses are challenging, varied, and tense, and we give
  you as many lives as you'll need... because you'll need as many lives as you can
  get! Can Zeta best the Xenogunner...? Only you can guide him to victory!

  --------------
  .
  The year is 1889. After months of deliberation, a Constitution is about to be
  approved, giving absolute power to Emperor Meiji. In the last two decades, there
  have been profound political and social reforms that have cleared the way for
  "modernization:" the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of
  European-style political, police, and judicial systems, restructuring of the
  army, etc. But not everyone is happy with these changes.
  .
  In these convulsive years, yokai sightings and encounters have increased
  tremendously. Some blame the barbarians, others accuse nostalgics of the bakufu
  times, and a few even dare to hold His Majesty responsible. The truth is nobody
  knows the reason behind the uptick in sightings for sure.
  .
  The Yokai Gari Kai, or Yokai Hunters Society, has been around for centuries,
  gathering brave people from any social stratum willing to fight these
  abominations that lurk in the shadows.
  .
  ---
  .
  The adventures you can play range from facing the monster of the week, to
  complex investigations or political plots, to routine cleansing jobs. A horror-
  genre approach to the game's stories is recommended, with bonus points if it
  gestures towards the psychological horror characteristics of many Japanese films
  and comics.
  .
  This game was created as an entry for the Goon Jam, and it's based on Tunnel
  Goons by Nate Treme.

developer: Unnecessary Games

genre: Role Playing
description:
  "You are Me" is a 2-player game about 5 minutes long (per iteration) designed to
  be played anywhere.
  .
  Have you ever put yourself in another person's shoes? Have you ever allowed
  someone to put themselves in your shoes? In "You Are Me" one player asks the
  other to be him or her for a few moments and make a choice. The game may then
  end or another iteration of the same situation may be played. At each iteration
  the information increases and the identification with the other as well.
  .
  This game is a tool that can be used for fun or serious games, depending on the
  proposed situation. The aim is to understand each other by playing.
  .
  It does not require cards, dice or other components.
  .
  One of the players must have read these rules. It is not necessary for the other
  to have read it (although the first time this could slightly lengthen the
  playing time).

  Transcendent Roguelike Solitaire
  .
  You have perished, but the fungal spores that suffuse your corpse cannot be
  destroyed so easily. After a timeless time, you return to a body, though you
  don't remember if it is yours or not. You are reconstituted, but also
  transformed.
  .
  This game represents a risky, cyclical search for meaning in a vast and hostile
  mycological landscape. Your personal power is tracked in the playing cards kept
  in front of you. If you win the battles in the forest, your power will increase.
  The forest is dealt in front of you, explored, shuffled, and dealt again.
  Sometimes you will find what you are looking for in the forest before you die.
  Sometimes not.
  .
  Roguelike Solitaire
  .
  Fight monsters in the forest! Deal quick card layouts for yourself and the
  forest, resolve the round, do it again. The more rounds you play, the more you
  level up your power. When you beat the game, you could stop. Or you could mark
  down a transcension bonus and go around again, stronger from the start.
  .
  Inspirations
  .
  This game was inspired in equal parts by Peach Garden Games Apex Predator, the
  videogame genre of "idle games", and a meme about mushrooms.

  You have no idea how long it's been since you last set foot outside your cramped
  little apartment. You don't really talk to anyone. You can't focus on work. You
  barely have any appetite to speak of, literally and figuratively. Even casually
  reading Twitter makes you anxious.
  .
  Somehow, you thought moving to a new city would help you meet people you
  actually like. That you'd find fun activities to do and better opportunities all
  around. You used to be pretty good at faking your way around being a social
  butterfly. People actually seemed to like you, and the stuff you made and
  performed. But now? You can't even remember being that person.
  .
  Maybe you should go outside. Maybe it will help.

  I was once watching a certain beloved show about a sentient creek. When I
  brought it up at work, someone mocked me. I quickly shouted at them "YOU
  WOULDN'T LAST ONE MINUTE ON THE CREEK". This brewed in my skull for years.. Now
  I offer you a TROIKA! compatible version of this experience. So uh.. roll up a
  character with the background of choice.
  .
  This is a cosmic dread simulator,  that could also function as a funnel. Maybe
  you're playing a game and you need a duel and someone shouts "YOU WOULDN'T LAST
  ONE MINUTE ON THE CREEK"... ya.. now u kno what will happen.
  .
  You could also use it as a quick way to level up your TROIKA! characters.
  .
  It's also totally functional as a 1 player game.
  .
  let me know in the comments how many seconds you make it on the creek... maybe
  we'll make a leaderboard. Currently a pickup truck made it 10 seconds before
  taking a frisbee to the face and being sent to its doom in the creek.

  The year is 2183, the Zenonians have launched a full scale platenary invasion on
  Earth, cities are being burned to ground, population's rapidly shrinking, the
  last lines of defense are being obliterated.
  .
  The only solution is to launch a suicide mission, where the best pilots will
  have a task of destroying certain enemy targets while destroying the enemy
  armies while at it. Operation "Zenohell" starts now!
  .
  Welcome to 90s Arcade Shooting Hyper Medal Collecting Action!
  .
  Zenohell is a shmup inspired by early/mid 90s offerings from the arcades, made
  by a bunch of shmup loving passionates in Team Grybanser Fox, intended to try to
  recreate that game feel back when things were simple and challenging. It will
  come out in late 2015 and it will feature:
  .
  - 6 (+1 Secret) Stages filled to brim with bosses and medal collecting action!
  .
  - 3 (+3 Secret) Ships offering completely different playstyles!
  .
  - Unlockables!
  .
  - A stage practice mode where you can practice each stage on all the
  difficulties, unlock more stages as you get better.
  .
  - A simple scoring system that needs no strategy guides and is all about
  risk/reward.
  .
  - A multi-genre soundtrack composed by Jrgen Sjlander
  (https://soundcloud.com/dj_emphatic)
  .
  And more, however it's up to you to find it out when you play it yourself!
  .
  Basic Controls (those can be reconfigured in options):
  .
  Z - Shoot

  ... I've never watched an episode of Power Rangers in my life. And yet, I'm
  pretty sure that this is accurate.
  .
  Zoom Scouts is an extremely silly story game. You are the Zoom Scouts, radical
  teens and tweens who have been granted martial arts prowess and animal-shaped
  robot vehicles that you use to battle the evils that keep targeting your
  hometown of Sunny Beach. But most of that stuff is kind of boring; this game
  only really cares about the last part of the episode, when you form into the
  Mega Mech to fight the giant rubbery monster attacking the city!
  .
  Work together! Control a robot! Fight a monster! This is 100% goof-em-up role
  playing, made with video chat services in mind (although you could do it live
  together if you want). Earn tokens  by allowing the monster to beat up the Mega
  Mech; spend tokens to beat up the giant monster, and unleash your ultimate
  attack when the episode is almost over to save the day. Until next week.
  .
  Have you ever wanted to uppercut a kaiju all the way to the moon? Do you have
  detachable robot fists you don't intend to use until the final blow? Have you a
  yearning to find out what's going on at Sinister Sarah's dastardly space base?
  Then Zoom Scouts is here for you.

description:
  Chase the high score as you fight wave after wave of enemies intent on your
  doom!
  .
  ZZap! is my first game. It's a simple and fun frenetic twin-stick shooter.  It's
  the kind of game I would've designed for the Atari 2600 when I was 5 years old,
  if I could've.
  .
  Simply download and unzip 'ZZAP.ZIP', and play 'ZZAP.EXE'.
  .
  You pilot mankinds's last, best starfighter. In a hyperspace subdimension far
  removed from Einsteinian physics, you must hold back a flood of vicious aliens
  and their hostile technologies. As you destroy the horde, your score (and
  multiplier) increases, but so does your enemy's effort to destroy you, as they
  send new creatures and ships against you: Enemy ships can be docile and aimless,
  or aggressively fire weapons of their own. Some pursue you when angered, or
  become more dangerous when killed. Others recklessly explode when activated by a
  nearby starfighter - can you use this to your advantage?
  .
  More kills means a higher score multiplier, but don't get hit! You'll lose a
  life and halve your multiplier. Grab powerups to boost Points and Multiplier
  further, enhance your Laser to cope with the onslaught, or detonate a Bomb to
  buy a second of breathing space. Score high enough and you might even get an
  extra life.
