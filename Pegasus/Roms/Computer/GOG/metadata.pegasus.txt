publisher: Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.
genre: Adventure;Horror
description:
  The 11th Hour is the sequel to the widely successful game, The 7th Guest. It
  utilizes a much improved video compression engine by Graeme Devine and is also
  the game which brought forth Trilobyte's eventual demise.
  .
  This time you play the role of Carl Denning, boyfriend to the reporter Robin
  Morales. Robin has mysteriously vanished while trying to delve into the secrets
  of the rotting mansion of the once evil mastermind, Henry Stauf.
  .
  The game features new puzzles, redone graphics and indeed an improved engine -
  much smoother, with 16 bit graphics and an entirely new soundtrack. The basic
  gameplay is still similar to its predecessor: the player walks through the
  mansion, watches FMV sequences and solves logic riddles. The so-called GameBook,
  a laptop, can be consulted to receive puzzle hints.

  Henry Stauf's mansion had been abandoned for as long as anyone dare remember.
  Stauf was a master toy maker, a maker of amazing puzzles and this strange house
  was his greatest creation. Now, the mansion stands empty, rotting ever since the
  children started dying, ever since the six guests came. Now there are only the
  eerie lights and the terrible sing-song rhymes of the children...\n
  And suddenly, you are in the house. You move from room to haunted room, step by
  terrifying step, as scenes from that night of horror come to life. Because
  Stauf's game isn't over. There were six guests the world knew about - and there
  was one other. Stauf's mad mansion lives again. And only you can end the
  nightmare and learn the secret of The 7th Guest.

developer: Halberd Studios

genre: Action;Adventure;Metroidvania
description:
  A fateful night of sorrow and ancient magic changed the life of a young child
  forever, and with it, everything else as mankind knew it. For 9 long years, the
  world has been submerged in the deepest of shadows, robbing every object and
  living creature of their color, their joy, and most importantly, hope.
  .
  Many brave souls have tried to venture inside the corrupting depths of Talos
  Castle, a long-abandoned orphanage from which the curse stemmed. All have
  failed, except for one. Armed with little other than her halberd and sheer
  nerve, Europa's daunting quest is clear: enter the castle, find the source of
  darkness, and return color to the lands before it is too late.
  .
  However, this adventure is not for Europa to face alone. In her most desperate
  hour, Europa encounters Apino, a cute magical bear with the ability to heal,
  cleanse the corruption and protect his allies.
  .
  While exploring the castle, Apino can shoot powerful projectiles at enemies,
  open locked doors and shield Europa from ranged attacks.
  .
  Enhance your battle prowess by acquiring elemental armors. Master the might of
  lightning, water, earth and fire to defeat a vast assortment of enemies.
  .
  Use the elements to your advantage to travel the map dynamically, surprise
  bosses while you change armors on the fly and perform strong combos. Obtain
  special abilities to swim against waterfalls, travel underground tunnels or
  glide through warm air currents to access hidden locations and uncover their
  secrets.
  .
  Meet enigmatic composers that will aid you in your mission. With the special
  appearance of Michiru Yamane and Norihiko Hibino, both as NPCs and composers of
  several tracks tuned to 432hz, a soothing frequency used in what's known as
  healing music. And there is more to music than meets the eye. Hidden bosses with
  musical attack patterns lurk in the shadows ready to strike. In fact, music is
  the binding thread that brings gameplay and storytelling together; from
  collecting musical notes, to performing a healing lullaby to restore your
  health, music is all but the soul of the game.

  Once, the land of Akalabeth was peaceful and quiet. But then came Mondain, an
  evil and ambitious man who created dungeons and populated them with foul
  creatures. The noble warrior British was able to drive Mondain from Akalabeth,
  but the monsters he brought with him remain.
  .
  As either a fighter or a mage, it is your job to explore Akalabeth, descend into
  the dungeons and vanquish the beasts dwelling within. On an overhead map of the
  land, one can find the dungeons, towns where one may buy supplies, weapons and
  armor, and a castle, where one will be given quests by Lord British. To fulfill
  such a quest, a certain type of creature must be destroyed in a dungeon.
  .
  Inside the dungeons, the view switches to a first-person perspective. Fight,
  explore and find treasure on your way to complete a quest. Each successive quest
  will require you to destroy a stronger monster, which will reside on a deeper
  dungeon level than the one before it.

  Akalabeth is the precursor to the Ultima series.

description:
  In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the player takes on the role of Daniel, an
  amnesiac man trapped in the mansion of a Prussian Baron named Alexander. The
  only clues to Daniel's true identity are mementos and notes left behind by
  Daniel himself, who reminds himself to find and kill Alexander. Gameplay has the
  player searching for Daniel's diaries and other notes and journals of the poor
  souls who have crossed Baron Alexander. The player must solve the mystery of the
  mansion while running from a Shadow that is constantly chasing the player
  throughout the game.
  .
  The game takes place from a first person perspective, however there are no
  weapons. Daniel cannot fight monsters and the only choice is to run or hide.
  Along with self-preservation, the players must keep the hero sane. In order to
  stay sane, he must keep moving and pushing the plot forward, as well as making
  sure there is always light. It is often necessary to scour every corner for oil
  and tinderboxes. Oil will allow Daniel to use a lamp to provide him with light
  and tinderboxes can be used to light candles and torches strewn throughout the
  mansion. If Daniel remains in the dark for too long, he will gradually lose his
  sanity. As Daniel loses sanity, the world will distort and become hard to
  navigate and the monsters will be able to sense the player. The player must
  evade the monsters entirely, but this will affect Daniel's sanity as to hide
  from the monsters, the player must also hide in the dark. The player must also
  never look at the monsters because if Daniel stares at them too long, his sanity
  will be fully compromised.
  .
  The player must solve various puzzles and the game is very much a fully
  interactive adventure game. Interaction with the environment is performed by
  using a physics based method where the mouse is emulated as a hand, meaning the
  player will need to rotate it to turn wheels or use it to grab drawers and pull
  them open by moving the mouse. It is also possible to pick up objects and throw
  them to distract the shadow or solve certain physical puzzles.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Avernum is a remake of Exile, Spiderweb Software's first game. It uses the
  Nethergate game engine and plays in much the same way. A few things have been
  improved, however. Instead of just clicking on subjects players want to know
  more about in conversations, and getting static data as feedback, they can now
  select from several choices of what to say. It is a more natural system, like in
  Ultima Underworld. The combat has not changed significantly, except that there
  are new weapons, and many more spells, than in previous games, and these have
  altered graphics. The sprite animation has been expanded on, and additional
  frames added to the character animations. The isometric tile-by-tile scrolling
  view has not changed, but the many frames added on will help improve combat.

  such as in a game like Baldur's Gate or other similar RPGs. If you are not
  familiar with Exile 2: The Crystal Souls, you play as a party of adventurers.
  Your duty is to make sure that you help the ancient Vahnatai and secure a peace
  between your two peoples. Your people, the Exiles, need their help to defeat the
  invading Empire forces.

description:
  In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man
  named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in
  front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating,
  Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture,
  a paradise of free will built in the 1940's by a business magnate named Andrew
  Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent
  to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning
  about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack's main motivation while he tries
  to survive the horrors that the free will can create.
  .
  BioShock is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling
  technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once proud social
  experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has
  been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre
  scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of
  sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and
  propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950's.
  .
  The game's plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture's
  inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is
  therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to
  System Shock games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security
  cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements
  that further tie BioShock to its spiritual predecessors.
  .
  In its core, however, the game is more action-oriented, restricting the
  role-playing mechanics of System Shock 2 to abilities and upgrades that can be
  acquired and equipped by the main character. Most of the enemies in the game are
  Splicers, the deformed and insane citizens of Rapture. The protagonist has an
  arsenal of firearms to combat them, but is also able to use plasmids, which act
  similarly to magic and deplete a special energy called EVE. Various types of
  plasmids may directly hurt enemies, sabotage their movements, or enhance the
  player character's defense. Combat tactics often rely on successive usage of
  different types of weapons and plasmids. For example, encasing an enemy in ice
  with a plasmid makes it possible to shatter it to pieces with a single shot;
  protecting himself with an electric shield, the protagonist can electrocute
  enemies and strike them with melee weapons, etc.
  .
  The player can only equip a limited number of active and passive plasmids, and
  also has an inventory limit for every type of item. Restoring and enhancing
  items can be found by exploring the environment or purchased from vending
  machines. These can also be hacked, similarly to turrets, cameras, safes, and
  other types of locks. Hacking is presented as a Pipe Mania-like mini-game.
  .
  Plasmids, on the other hand, are mostly purchased by spending certain amounts of
  a mutagen known as ADAM. This mutagen can be obtained from mysterious creatures
  called "Little Sisters" - little girls that can be seen in most of the game's
  locations, accompanied and protected by very strong, genetically enhanced humans
  grafted to armored diving suits and nicknamed "Big Daddies". In order to capture
  a Little Sister the player normally has to defeat her Big Daddy. Afterwards, the
  player has the choice of killing the girl, harvesting large amounts of ADAM in
  process, or sparing her life. Depending on the player's moral decisions
  concerning the Little Sisters, the game's story will be concluded with different
  endings.
  .
  The Playstation 3 version adds a harder difficulty level called "Survivor Mode"
  to the game.

  Black Mirror III concludes the horrific tale of the Gordon family, the string of
  murders connected with them, and the curse of the Black Mirror Castle which
  began in the first game, The Black Mirror.
  .
  This game starts within minutes of where Black Mirror II ended. The Black Mirror
  Castle is burning, and Adrian Gordon (aka Darren Michaels), son of Samuel Gordon
  from the first game, is found running through the forest holding a lit torch.
  The police arrest him as their prime suspect, but they get nowhere during their
  interrogations since his own mind is a mass of confusion. While in custody,
  Adrian is plagued by convoluted, gruesome nightmares that interrupt his sleep at
  night and haunt him by day. When someone unknown posts his bail, he is set free.
  He has so many unanswered questions and so many fears. He gradually begins to
  suspect that his past is irrevocably linked with evil.
  .
  Black Mirror III is a third person, single-player, point-and-click adventure
  game much the same as the previous game but with improvements to sound and
  graphics. Its six chapters take place in Willow Creek and the areas near the

  One of the darkest games of all time, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain for the PC
  takes gamers on an epic quest through a gothic universe fraught with murder,
  magic and vengeance.
  .
  Accentuated with cinema-quality voice-overs, dynamic lighting effects and more
  than 25 minutes of stunning full-motion-video footage, Legacy of Kain features
  an engrossing storyline that invites gamers to embark on a journey through an
  expansive world containing more than 100 hours of intense, blood-sucking, spell-
  casting gameplay.
  .
  The nobleman Kain has been slain by a group of bandits and in his death, he is
  revived by the necromancer Mortanius for his own ends. Kain is returned in the
  form of a vampire and yearns to exact vengeance on those who killed him.
  Stronger and faster than a human being, coupled with a thirst for blood that
  must be satisfied regularly, he is able to dispatch his killers quickly.
  However, Mortanius and other forces seek to use him as a tool in a greater plot.
  Mortanius is of the Circle of Nine, the guardians of the Pillars of Nosgoth.
  These pillars, connected to the world and balancing the forces, have become
  corrupted and the Circle members been driven mad. At the Pillars, Kain meets
  Ariel - a former guardian of the Pillar of Balance, now a spirit after being
  murdered by an unseen assailant. She informs Kain of his relation to the Pillars
  and that the only way for him to restore the balance is to seek out each
  guardian and kill them. The fate of Nosgoth may hang on Kain decisions.
  .
  Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain is an action game where the player controls the
  vampiric Kain. As a vampire, Kain is able to withstand sunlight, but is harmed
  by water. However, he is able to obtain several cursed abilities and spells such
  as being able to transform into a bat, wolf, and even a cloud mist respectively,
  as well as learning the ability to disguise himself from creatures of weaker
  mind. Kain is also fixated on murder and is a master of several ways to kill and
  destroy his opponents. As the enemies are slain in front of him, Kain may drink
  their blood to restore his health, which is always trickling away,
  representative of his insatiable craving. To aid in the slaughter of his
  enemies, Kain may equip different weapons and armor, each with its own unique
  properties.

developer: Hyperstrange
publisher: New Blood Interactive
genre: Shooter;Action;Horror
description:
  Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in BLOOD WEST, an immersive stealth FPS.
  Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the
  means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn't your typical Wild
  West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.
  .
  The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable
  monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore
  freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to
  complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the
  barren lands have to offer.
  .
  Blood West is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief
  series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor
  voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist),
  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The
  gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies,
  and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of
  ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?
  .
  The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the
  Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every
  living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark
  entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark
  occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.
  .
  In Blood West you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced
  NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes
  share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they
  might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.
  .
  The game won't hold your hand. You'll have to explore the land for yourself
  (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to
  approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out
  for hidden places and secret stashes. There's gold in the mountains! Fair
  warning - it's probably cursed.
  .
  If sneaking around isn't exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power
  advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet
  your enemies guns blazing. Blood West comes from the creators of the fan-
  favorite boomer shooter POSTAL: Brain Damaged, so much gratuitous fantasy
  violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!
  .
  One man's hell might be another hoarder's paradise! From simple one-use items
  like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight
  to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game,
  the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to
  discover, and there's a special player's stash crate for all those super-rare
  potions that you'll hoard and never use.
  .
  A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where's the fun in
  that? Blood West makes sure you'll have plenty of weapons to choose from.
  Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from
  standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up
  possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there's a wide selection of
  hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.
  .
  The RPG-like perk-based progression system in Blood West will allow you to
  highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy
  hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain
  experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts
  in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining
  skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you'd normally be able
  to explore in one playthrough.
  .
  Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic
  corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands
  call you, Gunslinger!

  Your mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be
  disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one.

developer: Headfirst Productions

description:
  Detective Jack Walters arrived in Innsmouth to solve a case of a missing person.
  But soon he finds himself confronted with terrible mysteries older than
  humanity, and with ghosts of the mysterious events that led to his incarceration
  in a mental hospital years ago.
  .
  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a first-person action-adventure
  survival horror game, based on the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and his short story
  "The Shadow Over Innsmouth".
  .
  Initially, CoC: DCotE plays like an adventure game, but soon it gains elements
  of a stealth game and of a first-person shooter. Notably, the game does not
  feature an on-screen HUD (not even a crosshair); Jack's health is hinted at by
  visual cues; as for ammo, you need to remember how much you have left before
  you'll have to reload.
  .
  The health system used in the game is uncommon. There is no "hit points" system;
  rather, Jack receives minor or major wounds in specific parts of the body, and
  if he breaks a leg he's slowed down. To heal himself and prevent death from
  bleeding out, Jack can pick up medikits which contain bandages, splints, sutures
  and antidotes, each of which is used to heal a specific type of wound. Ill
  effects emerging from the wounds can be temporarily suppressed with a fix of
  morphine.
  .
  Jack's sanity also plays an important role. When Jack looks at disturbing things
  or finds himself in alarming conditions, his vision blurs, he begins hearing
  voices and talking to himself. If this gets too bad, Jack may go insane or
  commit suicide. Also, Jack suffers from acrophobia, and looking down in high
  places will cause him vertigo.

description:
  Chroma Squad is a Tactical RPG where five actors decide to start their own show
  and conquer the hearts of spectators, inspired by the Power Rangers television
  show.
  .
  The five actors record a few episodes in a season before getting involved in a
  boss fight, the Finale. Fights, combos and moves provide points, which are
  calculated in term of experience, spectators and fan power. Episodes cost money
  to produce (actors are getting paid, equipment is used), but each successful one
  can provide cash and items (dropped by villains) to ensure further combats and
  to buy or craft improvements. Between each episode, it is possible to change the
  marketing campaign, according to different strategies (retaining audience,
  getting more cash flow or fans).
  .
  Cast actors, purchase equipment and upgrades for your studio, craft weapons and
  giant Mechas out of cardboard and duct tape. Once the cameras are rolling, you
  will control your cast of five colored-jumpsuit-clad warriors in dramatic,
  turn-based battles!
  .
  • CUSTOMIZE YOUR TV STUDIO: hire actors, upgrade your gear, do marketing, craft
  weapons, costumes and giant cardboard robots!\n
  • TACTICAL RPG COMBAT WITH A TWIST: combine your heroes' abilities with Teamwork
  maneuvers!\n

  of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar
  whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the
  expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange
  memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained
  something sinister...

developer: Brace Yourself Games
publisher: Klei Entertainment
genre: Music
description:
  Crypt of the NecroDancer is an independent video game developed by Brace
  Yourself Games. The game takes fundamental elements of a roguelike dungeon
  exploration game, and adds a beat-matching rhythm game set to an original
  soundtrack written by Danny Baranowsky. The player's actions are most effective
  when moving the character set to the beat of the current song and are impaired
  when they miss a beat, so it is necessary to learn the rhythmic patterns that
  the various creatures follow.
  .
  The mixed-genre game includes the ability to import custom music, and the option
  to use a dance pad instead of traditional controllers or the keyboard. The game
  was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in April 2015, being
  co-published by Klei Entertainment, for the PlayStation 4 and Vita in February
  2016, and for iOS, as Crypt of the NecroDancer Pocket Edition, in June 2016.

  Terrazael. A world torn apart by oathbreakers, warmongers, and wielders of
  forbidden arcane secrets.
  .
  A world on its last strand of hope brought to its knees by a Calamity centuries
  ago that tore down its mighty civilizations. Petty kings rule in place of grand
  emperors of old that wage fruitless, ill-advised wars picking over ancient ruins
  like glorified scavengers.
  .
  Lead a team of four students in the Brookstead Military Academy, who are shut
  down on the mysterious orders of King Varic. The ruler of the Kingdom of Delia
  is preparing to break a millennium-old treaty and Brookstead students make for
  fine cannon fodder... However, these four soldiers are destined for more than
  just acting as unwilling meat for another grinder.
  .
  They may not know it yet, but they will make their mark on history.
  .
  Lead soldiers into the fray across a world torn apart by endless war and magical
  cataclysms.

  mythical heroes.
  .
  Carefully nurture your squad to ensure survival through long bouts to make a
  difference in a seemingly hopeless world.

  Assemble the squad from 30 playable characters, with their own background,
  personality, and motivations, then train them and pick from 54 distinct classes,
  with their own iconic attacks and skills.
  .
  Outfit each team with hundreds of weapons and spells, from simple blades and
  missiles to ancient, eldritch artifacts that produce world-ending magic.
  .
  Defeat doesn't mean permadeath, but there is a price to pay: Every time a
  warrior falls, it means a grave wound, a stat penalty, and weakening your squad.
  .
  Hope is a rare commodity in a world ruined by Calamity, good thing these heroes
  are filled to the brim.

  Join the all-night ghost vigil at Harwood House. As part of the 'OPG' paranormal
  investigation team, explore the haunted buildings and investigate sightings of
  ghosts, long reported around the area of Wolfenden. Grab the ghost hunting
  gadgets and solve the mystery surrounding this abandoned building.
  .
  Welcome to Ghost Vigil
  .
  The aim is to prove the existence of 'ghosts' through paranormal experiments.
  The venue is Harwood House, boasting a disturbing history, waiting to be
  experienced, by you. We, The Oxford Paranormal Group, believe the building is
  haunted, not by a single unknown entity, but several. The O.P.G have placed
  several remote live cameras and experiments throughout the building.
  .
  Harwood House is now empty as it has been for 4 decades, but you can be the eyes
  in the dark... watching... waiting. Discover what happened.
  .
  The house was built in 1747, as a country home for Lord Harwood, his wife and
  young son, Edgar. The Harwood estate was modest, stretching to a few dark wooded
  hills, deep in the Oxfordshire countryside. A tragedy occurred, in 1749, when
  Lord Harwood lost his son to scarlet fever.
  .
  A mixed history then befell Harwood House; it was passed from one owner to
  another in quick succession. It would appear no-one wanted to stay, for long. In
  later years the house became a hotel, a maternity hospital and eventually, in
  1968, a children's home known as Shangri La.
  .
  Your Role:
  .
  You are new to the OPG, the Oxford Paranormal Group, but have to face your first
  'all night vigil' at Harwood House. Your investigation will begin in the Attic,
  as your designated 'closed door experiment', before exploring the remains of the
  abandoned Harwood House and the Shangri La children's home.
  .
  In addition to exploring your designated investigation area, there are also
  ghost cams available to see other parts of the venue, as well as interactions
  with your fellow OPG members via messages and walkie talkie.
  .
  Your mission is to monitor the equipment and paranormal experiments. Things
  start off okay, with potential activity; orbs, flashes, temperature drops...
  until midnight, when things become deeply 'unexplainable'. Who haunts Harwood
  House?
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Explore the old abandoned Harwood House after dark.
  .
  Use Ghost Hunting gadgets to discover supernatural activity, 'see' into the
  past, and hear the dead.

  to map the treacherous shores and waters of Trewarthen, England. Over the

  countless lives beneath the Fetch Rock Lighthouse. It is hoped that his maps
  will help navigation through the fog in that area.
  .

  light from the lighthouse has suddenly gone out without explanation and he
  should go investigate. Why him? Why now .. in the middle of the night?
  .
  Making his way to the dark Fetch Rock Lighthouse, he soon discovers that the 3
  lighthouse keepers have disappeared without a trace! Sifting through information
  left behind, Parker finds evidence of another presence - something (or someone)
  else is here! Is the lighthouse haunted? What happened to the three men? Why did
  the lights go out? And, what is the real reason he was asked to come here?
  .
  To find those answers, Parker will be mystically transported to different
  periods in the lighthouse's time-line. Exploring in first person "Myst-like"
  style, interact with objects, reading materials and puzzles. Ambient sound
  effects, moody shadows and eerie music add to the immersion factor.

developer: Access Games
publisher: Ignition Entertainment
genre: Action;Horror
description:
  Deadly Premonition is an open world, survival horror video game developed by
  Access Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was
  published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in
  Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was
  simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's
  cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by
  Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of
  Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York
  Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is
  similar to a series of murders across the United States.
  .
  Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video
  game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after
  its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.
  .
  The game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy
  horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a
  free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have
  their own schedules.
  .
  It has become known for its "headline making strangeness" and is considered one
  of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World
  Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both
  extremely negative and extremely positive reviews and is seen by some as an
  example of games as art.

description:
  The year is 1988. Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her
  job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation.
  While she's home, she's making some extra money as a photographer for the
  Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!
  .
  Thimbleweed Park hasn't changed at all in the year since Delores has been away...
  or has it?
  .
  ...Since when is the S&D Diner a five-star establishment?\n
  ...When did the PillowBear™ become all the rage?\n
  ...Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards?\n
  ...How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the
  bridge a year ago?\n
  ...Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.
  .
  In a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least
  of your problems...
  .
  Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure started out as a prototype for Ron
  Gilbert's new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little
  game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the
  small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.
  .
  This was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively
  “found art” from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we
  couldn't go outside IRL.
  .
  As a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can
  have fun with in these odd times. You don't have to have played Thimbleweed Park
  to enjoy this mini-adventure. (But if you do enjoy it, why not check out
  Thimbleweed Park, hmm?)
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  • Non-stop point-and-click fun!
  .
  • Return to Thimbleweed Park, the setting of the Best Adventure of 2017 award
  from Adventure Gamers and the Thank You for Not Still Living at Home award from
  Ron Gilbert's mom. (Or, visit Thimbleweed Park for the first time! No prior
  knowledge required to play!)
  .
  • Explore Main Street and solve puzzles to take pictures for Thimbleweed Park's
  hard-hitting newspaper. One of these days Natalie will get that Pulitzer, and it
  will be thanks to your help!
  .
  • Tackle increasingly difficult assignments as you get closer to figuring out
  what the heck is going on in Thimbleweed Park this time.
  .
  • Sample a new adventure game engine by Ron Gilbert, who created Lucasfilm's
  SCUMM engine and classic games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island back in the day.

developer: Ion Storm
publisher: Eidos Interactive
genre: Action;Adventure;Role-Playing;Shooter;Stealth
description:
  Some time during the 2050's, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug
  czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their
  push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed "gray death" is running rampant
  throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as "Ambrosia"
  manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce
  and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and
  control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French
  terrorist organization "Silhouette" bombs the historic symbol of friendship
  between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this
  attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is
  formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to
  attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a
  nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother
  Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when
  the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at
  UNATCO headquarters.
  .
  Deus Ex is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person
  shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes
  the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate
  global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and
  complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework
  of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and
  physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points,
  which may be distributed to increase JC's proficiencies in eleven different
  disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with
  various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking
  abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency.
  .
  Another way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These
  cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be
  installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with
  combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant DC abilities that can be
  used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are
  jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be
  customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased,
  and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to
  them.
  .
  The game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits,
  as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate
  different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player's
  preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways,
  e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer
  hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be
  influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to System Shock games,
  the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use,
  and discard various types of objects.

genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its
  pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser
  lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the
  combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power,
  they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering
  this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of
  them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent
  them from escaping.
  .
  As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until
  eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep
  under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength
  of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of
  the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of
  Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and
  suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead.
  Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth,
  and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.
  .
  Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or
  Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and
  armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The
  Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on
  treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can
  recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.
  .
  Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's
  shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements
  to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters
  will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic
  tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced
  spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon
  destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional
  attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally
  the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like
  done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item
  found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of
  the quest.
  .
  Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or
  BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation.
  Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other
  to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are
  removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be
  found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.

description:
  A group of scientists discovers an asteroid that is on its way to a collision
  with the Earth. Is there any way to prevent the disaster? Boston Low, a NASA
  veteran, is sent to command a space expedition on the asteroid. Accompanied by
  the journalist Maggie Robbins and the archaeologist Brink, Boston investigates
  the asteroid and finds a strange structure that undoubtedly belongs to an alien
  civilization. During the course of investigations, the team finds itself on a
  seemingly deserted planet. They have no knowledge of the planet and no
  possibility of going back. Will they ever discover the secret of this strange
  world and find a way to get home?
  .
  The Dig is a point-and-click adventure game with a simple one-cursor interface.
  Most of the puzzles are inventory-based, tending to be somewhat more complex
  than in most preceding LucasArts' adventure games. There are also a few
  logic-based puzzles, which require understanding and manipulation of alien
  technology and life forms on the planet. Traditional branching dialogue system
  is utilized; however, the game focuses more on puzzle-solving than on
  conversations to advance the plot.
  .
  The game's story is influenced by science fiction literature and movies, and
  strives to be realistic, departing from the comedy style of LucasArts'
  adventures. Despite that, humorous elements are present in some of the dialogues
  and text descriptions. The game utilizes hand-drawn graphics with a few
  pre-rendered 3D images.

  received its portion of technical care and now runs on modern operating systems
  without any extra shenanigans. The story, visuals, and gameplay are untouched -
  with all its charm and flaws. Enjoy playing the game on Windows 7 or later,
  without legacy DRM, no FPS lock, and with few extra DirectX11 settings.

publisher: GOG
genre: Action;Survival;Horror
description:
  The only thing louder than the dinosaurs' roars were the voices of gamers
  worldwide demanding the return of a survival horror classic.
  .
  We've listened - and now, the legendary Dino Crisis is back, fully playable on
  modern PCs.
  .
  Thanks to the tremendous efforts of Capcom and GOG, Regina's iconic line,
  'You're extinct!' no longer applies to the game itself. The timeless thriller
  that defined a generation of gamers is made to last forever, enhanced for
  today's systems, featuring all the original content you loved with numerous
  improvements.
  .
  The wait is over. Dino Crisis has been resurrected. And...
  .
  It will totally consume you. All of you.
  .
  Three years ago. A scientist died in an accident during an experiment. His
  research was on "Third Energy," a completely clean energy source. The accident
  occurred just as government funding had been cut off because the project was
  deemed unfeasible. To the public, it was nothing more than an insignificant
  piece of information. Until now.
  .
  An agent dispatched to a small country in the South Seas to investigate a top-
  secret military project brought back surprising information. At a military
  research facility in the Republic of Borginia, a scientist who was supposed to
  have died three years ago in our country has resumed his research activities in
  the field of Third Energy. Regina, a member of the government's spy team, was
  tasked with retrieving the doctor.
  .
  She heads to the isolated island of Ibis, where the military facility is
  located. The dark elite are trained for every conceivable challenge. For them,
  it is just another "job" as usual...
  .

  Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F
  series and many more) with optimal button binding regardless of the hardware,
  hotplugging and wireless mode
  .
  Let's go back in time to the PlayStation 1 era and reminisce about how Dino
  Crisis was presented to gamers back in 1999:
  .
  Raw Instinct takes over in this new, adrenaline-pumping journey into Survival
  Horror. Something is terribly wrong. Your covert mission to infiltrate an
  isolated research compound has gone haywire... now you find yourself pursued by
  a relentless, prehistoric terror. Suddenly, your mission becomes a desperate
  fight for survival.

  mode is stored locally.

genre: Action;Survival;Horror
description:
  A year has passed since the operation to retrieve Dr. Kirk.
  .
  Third Energy, both a source of "ultimate clean energy" and a potential "ultimate
  weapon," has proven to be dangerously unpredictable. The government, having
  taken control of the project from Dr. Kirk, continued its development. Then, the
  "accident" happened once again.
  .
  The research city of Edward City was completely destroyed in an explosion from
  the Third Energy reactor--an event far more catastrophic than the previous
  accident. In response, the government launched a rescue mission to retrieve the
  research data and any remaining personnel.
  .
  To reach Edward City, believed to have been displaced in time by the reactor's
  explosion, the government deployed an experimental, untested "time gate" device
  to send a rescue team back in time. No one could foresee the consequences of
  this mission--except one person: Regina...
  .
  Here's how we ensured that this masterpiece is better than ever and what you can
  expect with GOG's version of the game:
  .
  Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11
  .
  All 2 localizations of the game included (English, Japanese)

  series and many more) with optimal button binding regardless of the hardware and
  wireless mode
  .
  As is now tradition, let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit how Dino
  Crisis 2 was described back in 2000:
  .
  In addition to "Regina," the main character continues from the previous work,
  "Dylan" also makes an appearance
  .
  The number of weapons you can handle has increased, so use the characteristics
  of each to overcome difficult challenges!
  .
  More than 10 types of dinosaurs. The number of dinosaurs attacking at once has
  doubled!
  .
  The game takes place in the world of the Cretaceous Period...
  .
  The stage has moved from the facility-centered setting of the previous game to
  the world of the Cretaceous Period. Dinosaurs attack players in various scenes,
  including jungles, caves, lakes, and some buildings eroded by plants!

game: Divine Divinity (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/D/Divine Divinity (USA)/Divine Divinity (USA).json
developer: Larian Studios
publisher: Larian Studios
genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Divine Divinity is a 2D action role-playing game with an oblique (rather than
  isometric) perspective, set in a fantasy universe. The game borrows certain
  elements from Diablo series, most notably point-and-click action-oriented combat
  and item randomization. However, the game's locations are not randomized, and it
  contains many features of traditional role-playing games such as interaction
  with NPCs and multiple dialogue choices.
  .
  The entire game world consists of over twenty thousand screens, each one being a
  seamless transition into the next with weather effects as well as day and night
  cycles. The main quest progression is linear; however, there are plenty of
  sub-quests available, many with multiple solutions, and the main character is
  pretty much free to travel to most parts of the map right at the beginning. Also
  notable is the ability to loot almost anything, not just equipment or healing
  items, but also chairs, candle sticks, and pretty much anything that isn't
  nailed down (except tables).
  .
  In the beginning of the game the player selects between three character classes
  for the protagonist, each coming in two variants (male or female): Warrior,
  Survivor, or Wizard. Each of these classes has four categories of unique skills.
  For example, the Wizard can specialize in elemental disciplines or choose the
  path of summoning various creatures, while Survivor skills include, among
  others, pickpocketing and alchemy. Each class can learn the skills of other
  classes, and the differences between them are mainly the starting skills and
  stat bonuses as they level up.
  .
  The game features a random item generator similar to, albeit less extensive
  than, Diablo. Items at certain locations have fixed names, but the most
  attributes (like damage, armor rating, poison or stun effect, stat bonus, or gem
  slot) are randomized. The player can also improve their weapons by gems dropped
  from enemies, or bought from shops; the dedicated player may even embark
  themselves on the quest to find the legendary weapons.

developer: Rick Brown
publisher: Beyond Software
genre: Adventure
description:
  The follow-up to the original Lords of Midnight game uses a similar game system
  to its predecessor, but the story is now much more complex. Luxor the
  Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the
  evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of
  Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more
  characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish
  Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be
  turned back to Luxor's side.
  .
  The game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited
  amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions)
  and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground
  tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the
  area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less
  effective.
  .
  The characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey,
  Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't
  automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join,
  turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).
  .
  There are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game.
  Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many
  other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with
  practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the
  first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his
  death means total defeat.

developer: Kheops Studio
publisher: Microids
genre: Adventure
description:
  The game is played from a first-person perspective with the direction in which
  the player is facing controlled by the mouse. On each static screen, the player
  is free to look around 360o. The game's interface is very simple; there is no
  HUD, instead the player has access to an inventory in which all items are
  stored. From the inventory, the player can also access objectives, review
  dialogue and examine any documents they have acquired.[9]
  .
  To speak to people or interact with objects, the player must click on them with
  the pointer. As the player moves the pointer around the screen it can change to
  an arrow (meaning the player can move in that direction), a magnifying glass
  (meaning the player can inspect something in more detail), a cog with a red line
  through it (meaning the player must use an item on the object), a cog without a
  red line (meaning the player can operate the object without using an item) or a
  hand (meaning the player can pick the item up). When the player clicks on a
  person to whom they wish to speak, a list of conversation topics appear on
  screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an
  auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually
  from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the
  inventory in any way they wish.

  Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon is a 2013 point-and-click adventure video
  game developed by Koalabs Studio for Microsoft Windows, OS X, iOS, and
  Android. It was published on all systems by Anuman under their Microïds
  brand. In 2013 the game was released on GOG.com, and in 2014 was bundled with
  its sequel, Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy.
  .
  The game follows 2000's Dracula: Resurrection and Dracula: The Last
  Sanctuary, and 2008's Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon. The plot is
  unrelated to Resurrection and Last Sanctuary, but is the first of a two-part
  loose sequel to Path of the Dragon, telling the story of Ellen Cross, an art
  restorer employed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When a precious set of
  fifteen paintings is lost at sea during a storm, Ellen is called to
  investigate when one of the supposedly lost paintings is auctioned in
  Budapest. Her investigation soon brings her into contact with Bram Stoker's
  great-grandson, a mysterious uncatalogued sixteenth painting, and the legacy
  of Vlad Tepes. The second part of the story, Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy, was
  released in November 2013.
  .
  Shadow of the Dragon received very little attention in the mainstream gaming
  press, with limited coverage from professional critics, and what reviews it
  did receive were negative. Critics were especially disparaging about the
  length of the game, the linearity of the gameplay, and the implementation of
  the health system.

  Dying Light is an open world, action horror game. It takes place in a zombie
  apocalypse environment, similar to the Dead Island games by the same developer.
  The game is set in the large city of Harran, with influences of ancient Turkey,
  overrun by a mysterious epidemic. The protagonist is Kyle Crane, an undercover
  GRE operative sent inside a quarantine zone. His initial mission is to
  neutralize the rogue GRE operative Kadir Sulaiman, but he can also choose to
  focus on helping the survivors instead. He can freely explore the city using
  parkour and freerun mechanics. The game has a dynamic day and night system –
  during the day zombies are less aggressive, so players can gather supplies,
  weapons, craft items etc. and prepare for the night, when infested are stronger
  and more dangerous.
  .
  The focus is on melee weapons and just like in Dead Island various materials can
  be crafted into weapons by gathering supplies. Also borrowed from that game is
  the stamina bar that prevents the character from continuously hitting. Guns can
  also be used, but sound attracts others. By progressing through the game the
  character's abilities can be leveled up in the skill trees agility, power, and
  survival. There are often large groups of zombies that can be taken out from
  heights, by pushing them off, using projectiles or triggering traps. Instead of
  stealth there is more focus on escaping using the parkour mechanics. Unlike
  games such as Assassin's Creed it requires precise timing and aim to grab ledges
  and combine slides and jumps into fluid movement.
  .
  Progress through the city is furthered by unlocking safe zones where zombies
  cannot enter. During the day Crane mainly needs to scavenge, locate and save
  survivors, explore, set up traps and locate air drops. At night the slow zombies
  become much more agile. They do more damage, can sprint and will chase Crane.
  Especially the Volatile creatures are extremely fast and deadly, changing the
  game's pace with more focus on stealth as enemies will easily catch up. The game
  becomes harder, but experience points are doubled at night. Aside from traps,
  sound and distractions, UV light can be used to slow them down. There is also a
  dynamic weather system.
  .
  Dying Light offers an online co-op mode for up to four players. In the Be the
  Zombie mode there is asymmetrical multiplayer where one player-controlled
  powerful Night Hunter can invade another player's game at night and up to four
  players can work together to defeat it.
  .
  On 9th February the game was updated for free to an Enhanced Edition version for
  all platforms through a patch. This Enhanched Edition then replaced the default
  version of the game.
  .
  The Enhanced Edition includes the follwoing:\n
  - Dying Light Game Enhanced (base game)\n
  - Dying Light The Following (expansion)\n
  - Ultimate Survivor Bundle (DLC)\n
  - The Bozak Horde game mode (DLC)\n
  - Be the Zombie multiplayer mode (DLC)\n

  starts to rain, the crater slowly fills with water .... When the sun goes down
  and it gets dark, all units and buildings have lights on them.

  -daytrum Review
  .
  Games can be truly epic. Resources are plentiful, maps are huge, and battles are
  insane.
  .
  -Armchair Review
  .
  Fans of Age of Empires will want this title. Three story-based modes, another 5
  eras and 7 civilizations, random map generator, and both single and multiplayer
  game modes. Enough to keep you busy for hours and hours.

  done too recently, drawn me into a world and not let me to till the wee small
  hours.

  With a full time line of epochs, theres a lot to keep track of. All the

developer: Subset Games
publisher: Subset Games
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy;Vehicle Simulation
description:
  FTL: Faster Than Light is a tactical spaceship combat simulator, however rather
  than commanding a ship directly, the player manages and commands the crew of a
  ship in addition to several ship systems (power, weapons, shields, etc).
  Navigating the ship across a sector of space is turn-based, but ship-to-ship
  combat plays out in real-time. The game can be paused to make it easier to order
  the crew about in the heat of battle. Crew members can be sent to different
  stations (ship rooms) by selecting a crew member and clicking on his destination
  inside the ship. The ship layout is presented in a simple top down layout
  consisting of various rooms and corridors. There are more things the crew can
  do, such as fight fires, seal hull breaches and defend against invaders who beam
  aboard. Crew experience plays a vital role in the long run, as only a highly
  skilled crew can survive the later more difficult levels.
  .
  The game begins with a rather basic ship (several other models can be unlocked
  by completing achievements) and several crew members with no skills. The mission
  is to escape the pursuing Rebel forces by navigating eight sectors and reach the
  Federation Base in order to deliver vital information concerning the Rebels. The
  game is quite difficult and just reaching sector 5 unlocks an achievement. Along
  the way, you may encounters friendly or hostile forces consisting of Rebel
  patrols, Federation allies, distress beacons and traders who can supply improved
  weapons or special ship augmentations. For a price of course. Eventually the
  Rebels will advance far enough into a sector to make escape almost impossible,
  so while it is useful to explore as much as possible, making sure you can escape
  intact is vital.
  .
  The entire universe is randomly generated each time so no two attempts will be
  alike. The player also won't know exactly what sectors they will have to
  navigate until they get closer. Most encounters are randomly generated as well
  though the game steadily becomes more and more difficult with each passing
  sector.
  .
  Unlocking achievements allows the game to be played with a different starting
  ship and crew. Some require a completely different approach. For example the
  Engi cruiser has weak offensive weaponry but can often disable enemy weapons and
  keep the enemy harmless while it either uses remote drones to attack or powers
  up it's engine and escapes.
  .
  Faster Than Light is all about tactics and planing ahead. Though it features
  many different weapons and ship systems, it's up to the player to come up with
  tactics that will use such upgrades effectively rather than just get bigger guns
  and fight bigger enemies. To win the game it is necessary to learn which tactics
  work and survive long enough to reach the Federation forces and help them defeat
  the Rebels.

description:
  A devastating nuclear war had wiped out almost the entire population of the
  Earth. The civilization, as we know it, has been destroyed. The Earth has become
  a huge wasteland populated by mutated creatures. Only small number of humans
  survived and they formed communities living on the surface, where they mostly
  scavenge what remains from the pre-war civilization. Some lucky people managed
  to reach safety of the Vaults, huge underground dwellings, during the war.
  Recently, the water purification controller chip in Vault 13 broke. Without
  clean water, the people of the Vault cannot survive. One person is sent to find
  a replacement chip and ventures outside to face a dangerous world, hoping to
  return within a hundred and fifty days.
  .
  Fallout is a role-playing game that utilizes a character development system
  called S.P.E.C.I.A.L., an acronym formed from the first letters of the game's
  basic character attributes: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma,
  Intelligence, Agility and Luck. In addition to having these attributes, the
  protagonist can also learn and improve skills, as well as acquire traits and
  perks.
  .
  Skill points are awarded when the player character levels up; traits are
  assigned during character creation, while perks are obtained every three
  character levels. There are eighteen different skills in the game, divided into
  combat, active, and passive categories. Combat skills include weapon
  proficiencies (e.g. small and big guns, melee, etc.); active skills are used for
  support or interacting with the environment (doctor, lockpick, science, steal,
  and others); passive skills are mainly dedicated to social interaction (barter,
  speech, gambling, and so on). Traits bestow various benefits upon the character
  while also imposing penalties; in contrast, perks are purely beneficial. By
  developing and customizing attributes, skills, traits and perks, the player is
  granted a considerable freedom in shaping the protagonist in his combat-related
  and social behavior.
  .
  The game has an open world which can be freely explored from the onset. Only a
  few quests are required to complete in order to advance the main plot; a vast
  amount of side quests is available. Thanks to the game's emphasis on social
  interaction, many problems can be solved in a non-violent way; in fact, it is
  possible to complete the game without engaging in battles at all, running away
  from enemy encounters and concluding the final confrontation in a relatively
  peaceful fashion. Conversely, the player can opt for a destructive path, killing
  everyone in sight. A Karma system is used to track the player's moral decisions
  during the game.
  .
  Combat in Fallout is turn-based. Participants have a limited amount of action
  points (AP) per turn; each action (including movement) depletes a certain number
  of AP, eventually ending a character's turn. The player can target specific body
  parts of enemies during battles. Characters may join the protagonist, traveling
  together and participating in combat as a party. Though the player

  .
  Many of the reported issues appear to stem from missing one of the installation
  steps outlined below. While we work on improving the installation experience,
  please ensure you follow all the steps carefully.
  .
  - Team FOLON
  .
  Fallout London is a total conversion mod made by Team FOLON for Fallout 4 GOTY
  and requires you to own the base game on either GOG or Steam.
  .
  How to install and play Fallout London:
  .

  access the installation's instructions provided by Team FOLON. You will have to
  downgrade your version, then install the Fallout: London via our dedicated
  launcher.

  easy steps:

  default Fallout 4: GOTY Edition installation. You'll also need to disable cloud
  saves (as the save folder is shared between the game and the mod). If you'd like
  to play the default Fallout 4: GOTY Edition again, you'll need to uninstall the
  game and the mod, and then reinstall Fallout 4: GOTY Edition.

game: Fallout 2 (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/F/Fallout 2 (USA)/Fallout 2 (USA).json
developer: Black Isle Studios
publisher: Interplay Entertainment
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The sequel to Fallout starts eighty years after its predecessor. When the First
  Vault Dweller was forced from his home, he walked north until he found some new
  friends and founded a tribe in a suitable place. But some years after his death,
  the tribe is dying. The Elders decide that one of the tribe members, the "Chosen
  One", must find the salvation, a universal tool called G.E.C.K. (short for
  "Garden of Eden Creation Kit"). Sadly, the hero's only clue are the ancient
  disks the Vault Dweller has left, and the only equipment are his clothes and
  PipBoy. With courage and determination the proclaimed Chosen One leaves to save
  his village, unaware of the consequences his actions will carry.
  .
  Visually and gameplay-wise, Fallout 2 is very similar to its predecessor. Combat
  and character growth are handled the same way, using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
  attribute system and relying on skills to customize the protagonist. The
  sequel's environments are more vast than in the first game, with more
  non-playable characters populating it. There are more varied dialogue options
  and ethical choices presented to the player during the course of the game, as
  well as new weapons, armor, enemies, and a few minor gameplay additions, such as
  a car the protagonist can drive.
  .
  Gameplay-related changes mostly involve the player character's companions.
  Characters who join the party can now level up, equip armor, and follow specific
  strategies, as opposed to the almost complete lack of control over party members
  in the first game. Some characters are also harder to recruit, requiring
  specific quests to be solved or a certain Karma level. Reputation system is
  added, which works similarly to Karma (good and bad deeds), but only within the
  same town or community.
  .
  The quests in the game are more numerous and typically involve more complex
  situations and larger scope. Fallout 2 introduces quests and moral decisions
  with mature subtext: the player can choose various lifestyles for the main
  character, including getting married and divorced, become a slave seller, a porn
  star, or join the mafia.

developer: Strategic Simulations, Inc.
publisher: Strategic Simulations, Inc.,
genre: Strategy
description:
  Fantasy General is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world with some
  steampunk/high-tech elements.
  .
  The forces of evil, in the form of the dreaded Shadowlord and his henchmen, have
  conquered most of the world. On the brink of defeat, the player (in the form of
  one of four heroes) is summoned as champion who will change course, free the
  world and defeat evil - or lose all.
  .
  The game features 10 unit types from four realms with lots of upgrades,
  complemented by a similar plethora available primarily to the opponent. Most of
  the game takes place on battle maps. Outside of those there's just a bit of
  basic recruiting, setting research priorities and financial managing. Battle
  maps are hex-based and feature lots of different terrain types that require a
  suitable approach - cavalry will rule on plains but is crippled in swamps. The
  player should build an army that is composed of the right mix of units and can
  adapt to new situations.
  .
  The game will look similar to players familiar with Panzer General since it uses
  a modified engine of said game.
  .
  The game offers two modes: the campaign against the Shadowlord or arena mode
  (single battle) against a computer or human opponent.
  .
  In campaign mode, the player selects one of four heroes, each with his or her
  special abilities and sets out to defeat the Shadowlord. The player must prove
  his or her own ability to adapt play style and army across five continents with
  different challenges until the player finally defeats the Shadowlord on Fire
  Isle.

  the best colony in the ever competitive market. But before you can be trusted
  with the lives of colonists you must first prove your worth here on earth.
  .
  Main Features:
  .
  Puzzle-like terraforming system
  .
  Use a turn to select one "terraforming kit" to shape the landscape and get it
  ready for your colony. Place a water drop title in a canyon to create a water
  source and any flat land around it will become fertile soil. Raise canyons to
  create flatland so that it can become fertile soil or be built on. Raise
  mountains so that turbines can be placed near by to create electricity.
  .
  The only catch is your terraforming kits are preset in various shapes. A kit
  might have two water drop tiles and one that lower the terrain. This might give
  you water in one spot and a canyon where you wanted to build. The player must
  carefully place tiles to mitigate any downsides.
  .
  Buildings
  .
  Create the habitat for your settlers by placing necessary buildings for their
  survival, like farms, water pumps, wind turbines, and more. Build factories to
  supply your colony and have entertainment centers to keep your colony the

  and it's Iwad is named "TNT.wad") and the Casali brothers.
  .
  Game play in both is completely identical to DOOM 2, right down to the level
  progression (i.e. 30 levels and two secret levels). Other than the new levels,
  the only new things over DOOM 2 are new stories (both of which appear to
  directly follow on from DOOM 2 rather than each other) some new textures and, in

description:
  Set in the turbulent universe of Game Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 EPIC, Final
  Liberation allows you to lead the Imperial campaign in Volistad as Lord
  Commander Militant. Having eaten five Astropaths en-route to their new stations,
  Ork Warboss Skroll of the Evil Sunz clan is visited with (demented?) dreams of
  grandeur and conquest and launches a full-scale WAAAGH! on the Imperial colony
  of Volistad. With the might of the Bad Moons, the rapacious Evil Sunz and the
  Orkiest of all clans, the Goffs, at his disposal, Skroll quickly swept aside the
  defences of Volistad and took control of the planet. Leading an army of
  Ultramarines and Imperial guard, you must retake the system and cleanse it of
  the foul alien by completing missions and annihilating the Ork forces. Though
  the Emperor protects you, you must remain vigilant, for like all Orks, Skroll
  loves fitin', so he and his forces will take you to the last man and space
  marine. Only supreme tactics and precise execution will allow you to reclaim
  Volistad in the name of the Emperor.

  Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await
  the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild
  master in a quest for glory and gold!\n
  Hillsfar is a single-hero role-playing game (in comparison to other Advanced
  Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games, where the player usually controls a group
  of characters). A combination of first person perspective (when traveling in the
  city of Hillsfar) and third person perspective (usually in some action-style
  mini-quests) viewpoints.\n
  As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated
  mission-based plot: fighter, thief, cleric, or magic-user. Each class to a
  certain extent, have different assigned quests given by each respective guild.\n
  In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various mini-games that are needed to
  complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.
  These mini-games (and their viewpoints) include:\n
  Fighting in the arena (third person).\n
  Competing at the archery range (first person).\n
  Exploring buildings or mazes (top-down).\n
  Riding a horse outside Hillsfar while avoiding obstacles (third
  person/side-scrolling).\n
  Locking picking doors and chests (first person).\n
  Unlike most role-playing games, there aren't any randomly generated monsters to
  battle. In Hillsfar, combat only occurs in the arena.

  Unlimited Adventures allows players to create their own fantasy role-playing
  games, especially those set in the Forgotten Realms world, similar to  SSI's
  AD&D Gold Box series. The game is required to play the worlds created with it.
  .
  In Gold Box games the player typically controls a party of adventurers, leading
  them through cities and dungeons (presented in first person perspective),
  talking to people, finding treasure, buying things in shops, fighting battles,
  etc. When combat begins, the screen switches to a top-down perspective where the
  player can control each party member while they fight the opponent. This is also
  how games created with Unlimited Adventures look.
  .
  Construction Set\n
  The basic elements of each created game (i.e. design) are its modules, that is,
  the levels that the player will be travelling through. The designer builds the
  modules by arranging walls and choosing floors and ceilings. Then comes the most
  important part - setting up the events. The events control everything
  interesting that happens in the game: combats, text messages, Non-Player
  Characters (NPCs) joining/leaving the party, the party visiting a
  temple/shop/tavern, etc.
  .
  Unlimited Adventures comes with a lot of art, depicting various monsters,
  characters, items, etc. It is also possible to import own art. There are a lot
  of pre-made monsters (e.g. goblins, dragons, zombies, etc.) and humanoid enemies
  (e.g. brigands, bandits, evil mages, etc.), which the designer can edit freely.
  .
  Unlimited Adventures comes with a complete example design, "Heirs to Skull
  Crag".

  The story is told across four chapters. Like a Netflix series, Fort Solis can be
  binged in one intense session, or played chapter by chapter like an episodic TV
  show.
  .
  Welcome to Fort Solis
  .
  Responding to an unusual alarm call from a remote mining base, Jack arrives at
  the dark and desolate Fort Solis. With storm warnings imminent, he heads inside
  to make desperate contact. As the night grows longer, events escalate, spiral
  out of control and the mystery of what happened to the crew begins to reveal
  itself. The storms is approching, limiting Jack's escape as he looks to hold out
  until morning arrives.
  .
  Immersive Storytelling
  .
  Fort Solis looks to deliver a high-fidelity experience designed to completely
  immerse the player in the cast and their long night. With performances from
  Roger Clark, Troy Baker and Julia Brown, Fort Solis looks to deliver emotion,
  fear, empathy and much more with every chapter.
  .
  Supporting the core narrative are additional instances of story such as audio
  logs, surveillance footage of past or present events. Accompanying those are
  video logs recorded by all crew detailing the events before and perhaps even
  after that night the alarm was triggered at Fort Solis...
  .
  Grounded by the visuals
  .
  Fort Solis brings to players, the next level of details, facial and body
  animations. With the help of Unreal Engine 5.2 Fort Solis realistic universe is
  brought to life!
  .
  An isolated mining complex
  .
  The skeleton of Fort Solis is built above and below ground. The base contains a
  variety of locations each with their own surface and sub surface levels. Players
  will be able to explore the isolated storm bearing surface, the creepy service
  tunnels absent of any light or the multiple departments that help Fort Solis
  function on a day-to-day basis such as Engineering, Medical and Communications.
  .
  As the story unfolds locations can easily be revisited for additional story
  context or continue to serve as a backdrop to the fate that awaits Jack with
  each passing hour.

game: Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/G/Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers (USA)/Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers (USA).json
developer: Sierra On-Line, Inc.
publisher: Sierra On-Line, Inc.
genre: Adventure
description:
  Gabriel Knight is a wise-cracking bookstore owner and would-be author. He is the
  last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural forces
  of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment
  scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark
  past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The
  police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the
  beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new
  novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and
  plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.
  .
  Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure
  game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g.
  Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its
  supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this
  way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games.
  .
  The game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with
  verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants.
  Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for
  classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically,
  Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics
  and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.
  .
  The game's locations are done in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game
  adds full voice-overs to the dialogues, as well as narrator's voice to text
  descriptions.

  This is the third installment in the shareware Geneforge series by Spiderweb
  Software. In this fantasy RPG, you once again play the role of a shaper. Shapers
  are a secretive group that are capable of magically creating life (in the form
  of mutant creatures) to follow their commands.
  .
  In this game you will face many challenges, and choices, after your school has
  been attacked and destroyed by rebels - with dozens of different endings.
  .
  The gameplay is very similar to to previous Geneforge games. You create your
  character by choosing from three main types: Shaper: specializes in creating
  creatures to do your bidding, Agent: specializes in using magic, and Guardian:
  specializes in traditional combat (swords, etc).
  .
  You then use a pool of points to distribute to all of your statistics and skills
  in order to create the type of character you would like to play. You control
  only your main character in the game, but through the use of "shaping" you can
  add creatures to your party to fight for you. Gameplay takes place in real time,
  but combat is turn-based, using an action-point system for each character and
  foe during battles.

description:
  This is the fourth installment in the shareware Geneforge series by Spiderweb
  Software. Geneforge 4 is an isometric RPG with turn-based combat set in a dark
  and unorthodox setting that combines fantasy with unusual elements such as
  advanced genetic engineering.
  .
  The world is torn apart by a long-lasting civil war between an elite caste that
  previously held monopoly on creating artificial life, and a combined group of
  persecuted ordinary humans, genetically altered humans, and a variety of
  artificial creatures gone independent. Though the protagonist starts out as a
  rebel selected for genetic mutation using secret and risky rebel techniques, he
  is not restricted to only one side of the conflict.
  .
  The player may be joined by a several NPCs that would contribute to the plot and
  comment on situations, however, he is usually supplemented by beasts of his own
  creation that he can control. If his abilities are sufficient, the player may
  choose from a selection of fifteen unique and thirty modified creatures, each of
  which can gain experience and advance on its own. Geneforge 4 features a large,
  freely explorable world with a location system reminiscent of that in the first
  Baldur's Gate. There is a large number of non-obligatory and hidden locations.
  .
  A highlight of the game are its extensive dialogues with a wide variety of
  choices, as well as detailed descriptions of locations and special encounters.
  The plot is frequently praised by fans for its non-linearity, and the lack of
  emphasis on black-and-white morals. There is a large amount of side-quests, many
  of which are connected with the class of the protagonist, his abilities, his
  affiliations, or his behaviour in other encounters. Mutually exclusive quests
  are frequent.

  usually dangerous. The game offers six different classes to start building the
  character upon. As with the previous Geneforge games the player can put skill
  point emphasis in three areas: close combat, Shaper skills, and magic use.
  Compared to the previous game it contains a number of UI improvements and better

publisher: Empire Interactive Entertainment
genre: Strategy
description:
  Developed by Sick Puppies, Ghost Master is a strategy game with a difference.
  Your aim is to build up and control a team of ghosts, your goal to to scare the
  humans.
  .
  Set in the town of Gravenville, there are number of different scenarios to play,
  set over a variety of fully 3D envirnoments including the country house, police
  station and hospital.
  .
  Instead of playing with one single character, you build up an entire ghostly
  team. There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own
  personality - its own strengths and weaknesses. As the game develops the
  characters themselves will develop and grow. What's more, each one has its own
  unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood whilst others can
  cut the lights in the room...
  .
  Each time you scare a human or 'mortal', you will increase your plasm; the
  energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people
  will flee from the building, hence making your job more difficult.
  .
  Ghost Master has a true state-of-the-art AI engine which means the player gets a
  sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their every day
  lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with others... until they encounter the
  horrors you control! After these encounters they will become irrational, afraid
  and sometimes even go insane! As well as horror the game also contains elements
  of humour.

  You swiftly assemble a posse of outlaws, some with guns, others with the kind of

  moon. Together, you transform the prairie into an ungodly land echoing with
  gunfire and the screams of the hunted.

  But once on board the train, you discover it's not named the "Ghost Train" for
  nothing. What follows is the fight of your life through the uncharted badlands

  salvation at any cost.

description:
  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be
  appropriate for viewing at work. Hell Pie will feauture violence, blood, drugs,
  nudity, sexual content and strong language.
  .
  Hell Pie is an obscene 3D platformer that takes bad taste to the next level! The
  game sees you grab the horns of Nate, the 'Demon of Bad Taste'. He is given the
  honorable task of gathering the disgusting ingredients for Satan's infamous
  birthday pie. To do so, Nate must venture out into the overworld and do whatever
  it takes to ensure those ingredients are secured in time, or there'll be hell to
  pay!
  .
  Luckily Nate isn't alone on this quest, his 'pet' angel Nugget is there to offer
  support. Nugget offers his holy insight when needed, but more importantly is
  chained to Nate, so can be used like a grappling hook or swung around as a
  weapon. Nate can also equip horns he finds across the world to give him new
  hellish abilities.
  .
  Together Nate and Nugget will explore insane environments, meet tons of
  repugnant characters and witness some truly shocking sights. Hell Pie is a
  seriously twisted take on the classic mascot platformer, come along for the ride
  if you think you can stomach it!
  .
  Become a demon: You're Nate, demon of bad taste, the 8th deadly sin. While not
  taken very seriously in hell, he is feared on earth (by some...a few...2-3
  people at least).
  .
  Heavenly support: Nugget the angel does not only look cute, he's also useful.
  Throw him like a grappling hook, use him as a weapon and let him be your guide.
  .
  Freedom: Use the extensive moveset to overcome obstacles the way you want.
  .
  Stuff: Collect things! Lots of things!
  .
  Hell and above: Explore 4 big worlds and survive challenging platforming levels.
  .
  Fashion: Buy outfits. You're the demon of bad taste and should look the part.
  .
  Random bullet point: Did you know? Necrophiliac ducks exist.

game: Hellblade - Senua's Sacrifice (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/H/Hellblade - Senua's Sacrifice (USA)/Hellblade - Senua's Sacrifice (USA).json
developer: Ninja Theory
publisher: Ninja Theory
genre: Action;Adventure;Fighting
description:
  Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice draws inspiration from Celtic and Norse mythology
  to tell the story of Senua, a young woman and a Celtic warrior. The game mixes
  hack-and-slash action sequences with environment-based puzzle-solving and story
  sequences in equal measure. She suffers from psychosis, which causes her to hear
  voices, see illusions and often live in constant fear. Next to her mental
  illness there is also a darkness that haunts her, a source of power, but also
  something that affects and is shared by family members such as her father and
  mother, and her lover Dillion.
  .
  Almost all game elements and the way the story is told tie into the effects of
  psychosis, which was researched and implemented into the game with the support
  of both professionals in psychiatry and people who have experienced psychosis.
  Next to different voices that provide narration and play tricks with her mind,
  Senua is constantly surrounded by different voices talking through each other
  using different positioning with binaural audio recording. They also provide
  warnings during fights, for instance to announce an incoming blow out of view.
  The fighting only takes place in fixed locations against one or multiple
  enemies. Senua uses two types of attack, light and heavy, that can be strung
  into combos. There is an action to block and dodge, as well as a short focus
  attack that charges gradually and briefly slows down time, allowing her to do a
  lot of damage. Running can be done to approach quickly and launch additional
  attacks. Due to the shoulder-view close to the camera a lot of combat tactics
  are based around positioning and quickly switching between targets, optionally
  by locking on to them.
  .
  Many of the environments contain puzzles that need to be solved. There are gates
  that require runes to be located by finding their shapes in the environment, a
  sensation experienced by some patients when real life turns into a puzzle with
  rules and patterns. There are also illusions that permanently affect the
  environment, for instance by aligning Senua's sight to position loose pieces as
  a bridge. Other elements include light and darkness and portals with illusions.
  Optionally additional runes can be located to hear stories from Norse mythology.
  .
  The game is hudless. Enemies that are hit show damage through their bodies and
  composure, as well as their affected fighting style. The same applies to Senua.
  She can be knocked down a few times before dying. The game incorporates a rot
  system that grows slowly on her arm with each death. The game warns the player
  that once the rot reaches her head, the results will be permanent.

  After their job, of keeping the dungeons in balance, was done, our heroes needed
  a new job. Roaming the lands they found a call for heroes, a castle in need, and

  Pick two heroes to take into the adventure, controlling both heroes and using
  their special skills to navigate the dangerous castle hallways, rooms, and
  floors. Switching between the two characters to solve quests, puzzles, and of
  course clear the dungeons of all evil.

  Quests - The dungeon is full of problems, let's call them quests. These problems
  range from simple "find a key" to "use magic powers to light all magic candles
  and open the magical gate". Different types of quests require different
  solutions. Use the skills of the characters in your party to complete these
  quests.
  .
  Weapons - Your characters are your main weapons. The Elf shoots his arrows
  through multiple monsters, the Wizard has unlimited magic, the Warrior has a
  powerful melee attack with his hammer, and the Valkyrie besides having a quick
  spinning-melee attack can also detect secrets and important loot. The characters
  can level up to increase their firepower or find rare loot that enhances their
  character for short periods. This includes magic spells!
  .
  Secrets - Find secret rooms, level-skipping teleports, secret items, and more!
  .
  Perma-items - You will be able to unlock magic spells by collecting 4 shards of
  various magic books. Once all shards are collected the magic is unlocked. It's
  also possible to increase the strength of this magic by collecting the magic
  shards multiple times. All unlocked spells will stay unlocked even after you
  die, making you more powerful in your future attempts to reach the final boss.

developer: Dennaton Games
publisher: Devolver Digital
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  Hotline Miami is a violent top-down action game set in Miami, Florida in 1989.
  The protagonist is a hitman, nicknamed Jacket by the fans, who receives messages
  on his answering machine from mysterious employers. Most of the game consists of
  various missions that always start in the killer's own apartment. He receives a
  new task through his phone and then hops in his DeLorean to drive to the
  location and do the job. After each mission there is a short story sequence
  where he stops by a shop.
  .
  Missions are always set in buildings with one or more storeys. Jacket has to
  enter and kill everyone inside. This can either be done in a silent way, taking
  out opponents one by one, or as a hectic sequence where everyone is attacked at
  once. When alarmed, usually all opponents on a single level will be drawn to
  Jacket. There are various ways to approach opponents. Enemies can be taken out
  with melee weapons or guns. They can also be knocked out by punching them or
  slamming a door in their face, but they will get up. When they are only stunned,
  Jacket can perform a brutal finisher or pick them up to use them as a human
  shield. Enemies include regular guards but also dogs. Usually there is no
  starting weapon and they have to be taken from the environment or from
  opponents. Some of these are specific to the location, such as a boiling pot in
  a kitchen environment. Other melee weapons are baseball bats, knives, crowbars
  and more. Guns usually have a limited amount of ammo. When taking out enemies
  silently, the field of vision and sound need to be taken into account. In
  certain missions, Jacket can hang on ledges to move on the outside to another
  part of the building. He also has to take into account glass and transparent
  surfaces as enemies can see and shoot through them. All weapons can also be
  flung at opponents, usually just stunning them, but only one weapon can be
  carried at all times.
  .
  After each mission a rating is handed out based on various parameters. Gathered
  points unlock new weapons (which have a chance to appear randomly during a
  mission), and new masks are unlocked after each mission and can sometimes be
  found and picked up during missions. Before each mission Jacket can choose a
  mask to wear. It provides a perk such as a starting weapon, faster speed, doors
  that kill, friendly dogs and more. Both action and gameplay are brutal with lots
  of gore and blood. Often a mission needs to be tried multiple times as a single
  hit is fatal. In levels with multiple storeys, completing one acts as a
  checkpoint. Jacket has the ability to preview the environment, but only slightly
  beyond his position, not all of the map. There are also some boss battles
  against a single character.
  .
  Control is done through a gamepad or the combination of the mouse and the
  keyboard. There are separate actions for movement and Jacket can also aim in any
  direction. Actions include shooting, throwing a weapon and dropping it. He also
  has the ability to lock his aim onto a single character. Missions are unlocked
  one by one and the apartment always has small changes tied to the story.
  Sometimes there are longer cutscenes. Optionally players can collect letters
  hidden inside the environment. These open up the Puzzle section in a menu where
  the letters can be ordered into a phrase. Once complete, the phrase can be used
  in a later part of the game for a different ending. The game's soundtrack
  consists of a collection of electro and synthesizer artists, from eerie
  soundscapes to a booming rhythm.

  This hysterical, story-rich 3D adventure game is all about player choice and
  partying the way you want. House Party's unique AI and scripting system allows
  the game to shape and mold its content around your choices. You'll see something
  new or different each time you play. To date, there are hundreds of different
  stories, side-quests, and narratives, and thousands of branching stories and
  dynamic elements. Content is being added regularly, so it just keeps getting
  bigger and better! Each new game starts at the door as a blank canvas for your
  decisions.
  .
  One big house, packed with choices
  .
  Sweet news! Your buddy Derek invited you to a rager at Madison's house.
  Surrounded by a group of eccentric partygoers, you must navigate your way
  through the night - no matter how wild it gets!
  .
  Step into a sandbox adventure party game where even your simplest choices can
  impact the game in a magnificent way.
  .
  Explore thousands of unique branching narratives with fifteen distinct NPCs that
  react based on your every remark and action, paving the way for tons of hours of
  unpredictable and hilarious entertainment.
  .
  House Party's gameplay starts with the conversations and grows with the
  decisions made along the way. With no true ending but dozens of stories to
  navigate, the night is what you make it.
  .
  Discover Items & Uncover Wild Interactions
  .
  Explore a two-story house jam-packed with hundreds of items to discover, where
  every object has a purpose and some can be used in a variety of ways.
  .
  Change the party's music with the mp3 player, invite a surprise guest over with
  the laptop, enjoy as many drinks as you can (without getting caught), and...
  well, we'll leave the most exciting surprises up to you to uncover.
  .
  Show items to NPCs and they may react with varying dialogue or relationship
  fluctuations. Most of these hidden objects are vital for completing an NPC's
  personal storyline and winning their approval. Sometimes you don't even need any
  items to cause a ruckus. Play your cards right and maybe you can win them over
  with your charm alone.
  .
  NPCs (Not-Boring Party Comrades)
  .
  You don't have to thank us, but we invited fifteen of our craziest and funniest
  acquaintances!
  .
  A new-to-town sorority girl willing to do crazy things to fit in, the most
  brahsome brah around, a wild mud-wrestling southern belle, a freakishly buff
  straight-edge dude hawk-eyeing all the booze, and many more hilarious and unique
  personalities await.
  .
  Listen closely and the characters will chat about your actions, conversations,
  and choices, and also provide hints and insights into cracking their stories
  open. Throughout the night, you may overhear information about their backstories
  or catch them gossiping about other guests at the party.
  .
  Every NPC has favorite bands, personal beliefs, friends and enemies, and party
  goals for the night. Fully-voiced by amazingly talented voice actors and
  actresses, the partygoers feel vibrant and alive from the moment you set foot
  through the door.
  .
  With fifteen of the most interesting, reactive, and hysterical NPC partygoers to
  ever exist and a rapidly growing roster, there is always plenty of social
  variety around the house. All of them have inner motivations and strong personal
  opinions, making them fun to make various choices around and amusing to see
  interact with one another!
  .
  Make Friends, Enemies... or More?
  .
  As you navigate the party, your words and actions will dictate whether each NPC
  digs your vibe or is seconds away from knocking your lights out. One bad
  decision might get you beaten to a pulp, while a good choice might result in
  making an ally that will have your back for the rest of the night.
  .
  Every response you choose when speaking to an NPC changes how they feel about
  you. Keep an eye on your social gauges and watch your gameplay impact whether an
  NPC is crushing on you, feels so-so about you, sees you as a good friend, or
  hates your guts. Relationship values, good or bad, may open new doors. And,
  whether you're into guy love or girl love, it's possible to win most characters'
  hearts for steamy romantic fun at this party!
  .
  NPCs will respond differently whether they like you, love you, or hate you,
  unlocking or blocking off potential party choices and unique interactions. They
  also see what you do and hear what you say, so be careful because one small
  choice can change everything.
  .
  Interact With Celebrity Guests
  .
  Ever heard of the Game Grumps? Make the right choices and you may find Dan and
  Arin landing unexpectedly in the middle of the house party!
  .
  Explore their unique storyline, watch them hilariously navigate the festivities,
  and choose from one of the multiple paths to help them get back to their show!
  .
  Looking for a hot Spanish tutor to hop in and shake things up? Your decisions
  could make Lety Does Stuff come knocking on the front door. Explore her wild and
  crazy side story if you want a real taste of adventure!
  .
  As one of the only indie studios to ever integrate real-life celebrities into a
  video game, it has been a ton of fun connecting the guests to the story and
  welcoming the iconic humor and personalities of Dan, Arin, and Lety into the
  party.
  .
  This fall, Doja Cat joins the cast in an expansive all-new optional DLC story!
  We're excited to welcome the AMA-winning and Grammy-nominated music star into
  the game and can't wait for Doja Cat's character to ramp up the party even more!
  .
  Keep an eye out, because there may be more exciting guests on the way!

  Lacuna: Prologue tasks you - CDI agent Neil Conrad - with investigating the
  murder of a high-profile victim whose death could plunge the solar system into
  war. Solve the first in a series of connected cases that lead you deeper and
  deeper into the conspiracy at the core of this captivating 2D sci-fi noir
  adventure.
  .
  Another cigarette tumbles into the abyss. The sun is slowly coming up,
  .
  glistening in the sea of buildings below.
  .
  I look up at the stars one last time before they disappear.
  .
  They don't provide any guidance. They don't give a f*ck.
  .
  I have to make this decision on my own, and very soon. Problem is, I don't know
  how.
  .
  I've never been able to figure out why I do what I do. Not really.
  .
  No more time to think. I have to go.
  .
  Here's the deal
  .
  You are Neil Conrad, CDI agent. Awoken by the news of a murder, you rush into a
  case that will soon turn your life and the whole solar system upside down. Ask
  questions, collect evidence, and put the pieces together until the ugly truth
  reveals itself... or not.
  .
  No takebacks
  .
  The story branches and ends based on your actions. There's no going back. Sure,
  you can rush your way to the end - if you don't mind paying the price. Play your
  cards right, and you might make it out alive.
  .
  How far will you go?
  .
  Some questions don't have a right answer. Will you sell out a friend to protect
  your family? Will you endanger a loved one in exchange for public safety? Will
  you keep the peace or reveal the horrible, world-shattering truth?
  .
  Hungry for Point & Click Adventure?
  .
  While the classics were great in their time, Lacuna does away with the baggage
  of many adventure game tropes:
  .
  Pointing & clicking Platformer movement controls (WASD / controller)
  .
  Selecting all dialog options one by one anyway Non-repeating conversations and
  choices
  .
  Inventory management and counter-intuitive puzzles Immersive, story-driven
  mysteries
  .
  Pixel hunting Optional outlines on anything interactable
  .
  Story grinds to a halt at every puzzle can always be driven forward
  .
  "x will remember this" Real choices and multiple endings

description:
  In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for
  decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic
  obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with
  hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night.
  .
  Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The
  Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few
  strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages.
  .
  The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to
  defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies.
  .
  During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven
  and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming
  at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and
  repeat until the Magic Seal is broken.
  .
  Turn-Based Tactical RPG:
  .
  * The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits... and more.
  .
  * Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions... with their own stats
  and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own
  skillset and playstyle!
  .
  * Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and
  equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting
  with a gun? Do it!
  .
  * Manage your squad of heroes: they're strong, but they are few and have access
  to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good
  balance.
  .
  Hordes of Evil:
  .
  * Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few
  hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE
  attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards
  another day of survival.
  .
  * Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And
  because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites!
  .
  * Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses.
  .
  Protect the Haven:
  .
  * Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical
  weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander!
  .
  * Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults... every tiny bit of
  help is welcome.
  .
  * Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed.
  .
  * 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to
  tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil.
  .
  Roguelite Elements:
  .
  * The game is meant to be hard. You will fail... A lot. But every time you do,
  you'll grow harder, better, faster, stronger!
  .
  * Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of
  unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses.
  .
  * Tailor each run thanks to the Omens: a limited amount of bonuses that can be
  picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters,
  sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of
  destruction.
  .
  * Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain
  even the most crazy hardcore players.
  .
  Headbanger Soundtrack:
  .
  * Over 25 tracks of thunderous synths-driven progressive metal to guide you
  through this joyous slaughterfest
  .
  * Composed by the incredible Remi - The Algorithm - Gallego

  400 years have passed since the vampire Kain damned the world in the original
  Blood Omen, choosing to rule the world in damnation rather than die for its
  salvation. Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire
  armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious
  figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies

  access treacherous new areas to explore and the power to face stronger, more
  aggressive enemies. As you develop a stronger, more skilled vampire, you'll be
  rewarded with dozens of dazzling in-game cinematic sequences that unfold the
  continuing epic of Nosgoth, and Kain's attempts to ultimately rule over it.

  between runs. In fact, our game is a mix between Roguelite and a Dungeon
  Management. How did we achieve that? We've run many tests to find the perfect
  mix between a management and a dungeon phase!
  .
  Dungeon Phase\n
  First, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check
  their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat
  them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin!
  .
  You will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon
  crawler, heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you've
  placed. When a group of adventurers meets a group of monsters you've positioned
  in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!

developer: Synthetic Domain
publisher: Synthetic Domain
genre: Strategy;Tactical
description:
  The full version of Mainframe Defenders is available on GOG.COM. You can
  purchase it here
  .
  Mainframe Defenders: Meltdown - Prologue is a free introductory version of the
  retro-futuristic tactical game Mainframe Defenders. Command a squad of 4
  prototypes to protect the Mainframe from infection by an unknown virus. You will
  have to fight off assaults, destroy fabricators, download valuable data, clear
  infected nodes, and much more on your way to the deepest areas of the complex.
  Bypass the limitations and disadvantages of items and create powerful
  combinations. Destroy opponents with a variety of tactics: overheat them,
  destroy them with corrosion, absorb damage and shoot back. Don't rely on a
  single strategy - enemies may have a way to counter it.
  .
  The Prologue content:
  .
  6 of 24 mechs,
  .
  90 of 190 items,
  .
  1/3 of missions (1 act).
  .
  RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave
  soundtrack.
  .
  DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets,
  eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with
  debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind.
  .
  BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in
  Mainframe Defenders you have to combine different items with unique abilities,
  to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them,
  creating flawed, yet powerful build!
  .
  UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role
  in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets
  wisely, or you will lose.
  .
  PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to
  create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique
  mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk
  falling behind?
  .
  PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new
  units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to
  bolster your new strategies.
  .
  Synthetic Domain is a small team of hobbyists with a passion for making games.

game: Mainlining (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/M/Mainlining (USA)/Mainlining (USA).json
developer: Rebelephant
publisher: Merge Games
genre: Action
description:
  Mainlining is a thrilling point and click hacking adventure that mixes dark and
  dry humour with a gripping narrative that will have you hooked from the very
  first case. Following the government's introduction of the BLU Pill Act and the
  Secret Intelligence Service's reintroduction of MI7, all online personal data is
  accessible by the powers that be. Mainlining questions techno-ethics and whether
  it is acceptable for an organisation to have the power to look at personal data.
  What if someone else got the key to that?
  .
  Mainlining and its BLU Pill Act mirrors what's happening in our own world. On
  November 4th 2015 the The Draft Investigatory Powers Bill was discussed in the
  British Parliament's House of Commons for the very first time. It's likely that
  the bill will be passed sometime in 2016, meaning that domestic mobile and
  broadband providers will be forced to assist authorities with gathering data and
  storing it for a year. The police and security services will have access to the
  top line of the UK's population browsing history, as well as knowing what apps
  have been used.
  .
  Referred to in the popular media as “the Snooper's Charter” and opposed by a
  number of civil and human rights organisations, the Investigatory Powers Bill is
  positioned to aid security forces in tracking terrorists and serious cyber
  criminals who use increasingly sophisticated online methods.
  .
  Mainlining is a refreshing take on the traditional point and click adventure.
  The entire game takes place on the simulated desktop of the protagonist's
  computer. Assuming the role of a newly recruited MI7 agent and working within
  the remit of the Blu Pill Act, the player must use their skill, judgement and
  cunningness to gather evidence by hacking suspects' computers and phones.
  .
  As a MI7 operative your primary objectives are to ensure the perpetrator's
  arrest and that the courts have sufficient evidence to hand out the longest
  custodial sentences possible. However, you'll also have to make judgements on
  whether the case you're working on is complete. Move in too quickly and you may
  miss leads linking your case to much higher profile cyber-criminals. Act too
  slowly and your suspect may detect you and escape.
  .
  In excess of five hundred known criminals are known to operate within your
  jurisdiction, who will you investigate?

  After you finally defeated Lord Xeen in Might and Magic 4+5 (World of Xeen)
  among the ruins of Greyhaven you find a magic pyramid that seems to be the
  gateway to a new world. Nothing is known about the gate except that Xeen used it
  a lot, and thus the Dragon Pharoh sends you out to see what threat lies on the
  other side.

  The gate leads to Havec, a new world filled with new creatures and dangers for
  Might and Magic veterans in this, a high-level, stand-alone scenario that
  continues your adventures in the World of Xeen saga with the same engine and
  gameplay mechanics.
  .
  Swords of Xeen is a role-playing video game developed by Catware and published
  by New World Computing. It was initially released in 1995 as a "bonus scenario"
  in the Might and Magic Trilogy compilation (the "trilogy" refers to Might and
  Magic III, IV, and V). Subsequently, it was also included in several series
  anthologies. The game was never published in standalone form.
  .
  The game began as a mod based on the Might and Magic V engine, which was
  released in 1993. Personalities from Catware were responsible for leading the
  modding effort, with story contributions from Ellen Beeman. As development
  progressed, collaboration with New World Computing was established, and the mod
  received publishing support.

  rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.

  Like in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute
  to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return,
  with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection
  features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several
  locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or
  races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to
  travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is
  introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as
  mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain
  messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.
  .
  Compared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various
  characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely
  exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in
  this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time
  periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long,
  the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will
  eventually die.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he
  attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the
  guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra,
  where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the
  powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling
  nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of
  local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.
  .
  Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a
  sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing
  game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments,
  character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the
  same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the
  addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters
  may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.
  .
  This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring
  instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat
  from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option
  to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply
  by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap
  feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the
  game at any time.

developer: New World Computing, Inc.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Enter the land of Xeen, a mythical place ruled by two villainous overlords.
  Solve many quests and puzzles as you attempt to unravel the secrets of the World
  of Xeen.  This special version of the game is really two games (Clouds of Xeen
  and Darkside of Xeen) rolled into one, with two differences:  One, your
  characters are able to travel from one game to the other, doubling the size of
  the world available for exploration.  Two, CD-ROM technology has made possible
  the use of digitized speech in all places that call for it.
  .
  Clouds of Xeen is the fourth installment in the Might and Magic series, and a
  follow-up to Isles of Terra. It utilizes the same graphics and interface as its
  predecessor, and is generally very similar to it in structure and gameplay.
  Among new features is the possibility to keep notes recording quests and
  important locations in the game, a separate inventory section for quest items,
  and two difficulty levels.
  .
  Darkside of Xeen is the fifth installment of the Might and Magic, a direct
  sequel to Clouds of Xeen, and a completion of the overarching story arc that
  started in the first game. The game uses the same engine and interface as Might
  and Magic III: Isles of Terra, and is nearly identical to its immediate
  predecessor gameplay-wise. Compared to earlier games, it has a darker and
  somewhat more bizarre setting, and dungeon exploration involves more
  puzzle-solving. It is also more plot-focused and has a larger number of
  cutscenes.

developer: New World Computing
publisher: Ubisoft
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  After the corrupt Guardian Sheltem was defeated, the seemingly never-ending war
  between the Ancients and the alien Kreegans entered a new phase. Meteor-like
  spaceships populated by the Kreegans fell onto the technologically less advanced
  planet Enroth. The local king, Roland Ironfist, plans to attack the
  demonic-looking aliens, but is betrayed by a mage named Sulman and gone missing.
  Xenofex, the king of the Kreegans, establishes a cult teaching people that the
  Ironfist dynasty has lost its Mandate of Heaven to rule the realm. Meanwhile,
  the town of Sweet Water is invaded by the Kreegans, and four adventurers become
  involved in the battle and the search for the missing king.
  .
  The Mandate of Heaven is the sixth installment in the Might and Magic series,
  and the first one with the playing area done with a real 3D engine, allowing
  free exploration of the terrain (as opposed to the grid-based movement of the
  previous games) and camera rotation. Characters and many objects are represented
  by 2D sprites. The gameplay follows the formula of the predecessors with several
  changes, the most notable of which is the option to fight in real time.
  Real-time combat allows free movement, while the traditional turn-based one is
  stationary.
  .
  Character creation is somewhat more restricted: there are no other races but
  humans to choose from, and the party contains only four adventurers. Six classes
  are available: Knight, Druid, Paladin, Cleric, Sorcerer and Archer. A new skill
  system has been introduced, allowing the player to manually raise character
  skills (e.g. proficiency in specific weapon types) when the character levels up.
  Characters also gain access to skills of most classes, regardless of their
  original class designation.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Eight adventurers were traveling in a spaceship, pursuing the Guardians Corak
  and Sheltem. The Guardians went to the world of Xeen, but the adventurers
  drifted off-course and crash-landed on the planet Enroth. There, they had an
  argument concerning what to do next, and split into two groups. About the same
  time, Archibald Ironfist, the brother of King Roland of Enroth, escapes from his
  homeland and arrives on the continent of Antagarich, becoming a new necromancer
  leader.
  .
  Meanwhile, a nobleman named Lord Markham announces a scavenger hunt on Emerald
  Isle. The first prize is the deed to the Castle Harmondale, and it is won by one
  of the two parties of adventurers from another world. From that point on, the
  two groups become antagonists, pursuing their own agenda and allying themselves
  with the local forces, attempting to change the fate of the planet.
  .
  For Blood and Honor is the seventh installment in the Might and Magic series of
  role-playing games, and a sequel to both the third and the sixth one plot-wise.
  It uses the same 3D engine as its immediate predecessor in the series, and also
  allows the player to generate and control a party of four characters and
  alternate between real-time or turn-based battle systems. As opposed to the
  human-only party of the previous game, the player can choose between humans,
  elves, dwarves, and goblins. The class and skill system from the sixth game
  returns as well, with a few minor adjustments.
  .
  This installment of the series places an emphasis on moral decisions, allowing
  the player-controlled party to ally with different factions and ultimately
  choose either a good or an evil path. There are also side quests in the game,
  some of which are time-sensitive and require the player to consult an in-game
  calendar. The card mini-game Arcomage is introduced as well.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  For over a thousand years, the races of the Ancients and the Kreegans were
  waging an interstellar war. Eventually, the heroes of the planet Enroth and
  their allies managed to stop the invading Kreegans. However, the Ancients would
  rather see an entire world annihilated than let it fall into the hands of their
  sworn enemies. A planeswalker named Escaton, serving the Ancients, arrives on
  the continent of Jadame and unleashes a great storm, damaging the borders to
  Elemental Planes. Terrifying creatures begin to invade Enroth. Unexpectedly, the
  fate of the world lies in the hands of a lowly caravan guard from Dagger Wound
  Islands.
  .
  Day of the Destroyer is the eighth installment in the Might and Magic series,
  and a sequel to For Blood and Honor. The game's engine is virtually unchanged
  from the one used in the sixth game, apart from a few minor tweaks. The biggest
  difference from all the previous games in the series is the player's inability
  to create an entire party. Instead, the player generates one character, while
  the others at first act as NPCs in the game world and must be recruited. The
  active party can hold up to five characters. Instead of the traditional classes,
  the differentiation of the characters is mainly manifested in their races, which
  include, among others, minotaurs, vampires, and dark elves. The player can also
  choose to ally with different factions and complete different quests for them.

  WELCOME TO THE FUTURE\n
  The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could
  imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands
  upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies.\n
  Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered.
  With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own
  crooked empires.
  .
  You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the
  darkest corners of your suspects' minds. You creep into their dreams, expose
  their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require.

description:
  The Outer Worlds Expansion Pass is available here
  .
  The Outer Worlds is an award-winning single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from
  Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division.
  .
  Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the
  galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep
  conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the
  furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power,
  the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story
  unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned
  variable.
  .
  KEY FEATURES
  .
  The player-driven story RPG
  .
  In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up
  to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your
  character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.
  .
  You can be flawed, in a good way
  .
  New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the
  flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your
  experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked
  by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting
  the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk
  immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character
  you want while exploring Halcyon.
  .
  Lead your companions
  .
  During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of
  characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these
  companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you
  to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
  .
  Explore the corporate colony
  .
  Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate
  board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when
  the terraforming of the colony's two planets didn't exactly go according to
  plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space
  stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.

genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Stealth
description:
  Outlast is a first-person survival horror game with stealth elements. You play
  as Miles Upshur, a freelance journalist who breaks into a long-abandoned, but
  recently re-opened mental asylum. Inside he finds dead bodies, mental patients
  and a hint of some terrible experiment gone wrong.
  .
  As Miles wanders though the asylum he encounters various mental patients, both
  passive and aggressive. Stealth approach is advised, since if aggressive
  patients spot him they will try to hunt him down searching the area where they
  last saw him. Miles has no means to protect himself, but he can effectively hide
  behind and under the furniture, climb ledges and slide in narrow gaps. The only
  tool he has is a video-camera with night vision function that allows him to
  navigate dark places. Night vision consumes batteries which Miles must collect
  throughout the asylum.
  .
  At certain scripted moments the stealthy pace of the game changes and Miles
  finds himself hunted by the patients in runaway sequences reminding of the
  escape from the hotel in Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.

genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Stealth
description:
  Outlast 2 is a first-person survival horror video game developed and
  published by Red Barrels. It is the sequel to the 2013 video game Outlast,
  and features a journalist named Blake Langermann, along with his wife Lynn,
  roaming the Arizona desert to explore the murder of a pregnant woman, Jane
  Doe. Unfortunately, Blake and Lynn get separated in a helicopter crash, and
  Blake has to find his wife while traveling through a village inhabited by a
  sect that believes the end of days is upon them.
  .
  Outlast 2 is a first-person survival horror game that, like its predecessors
  Outlast and Outlast: Whistleblower, is a single-player campaign. It is set in
  the Sonoran desert. The game is also carrying over the found footage
  characteristics from the first game. The player controls the investigative
  journalist Blake Langermann, who investigates a dilapidated rural area in
  Supai, near the Sonoran Desert.
  .
  Langermann is completely unable to fight and can only defend in scripted
  scenes similar to the original Outlast, and can hide in lockers, crouch,
  run, jump, walk, vault, slide and climb much like the first game but the
  player has a much more limited stamina meter and must manage how long they
  run or else they will become slower and exhausted causing their pursuer to
  catch up to them. He only possesses a camcorder, which has night vision
  enabled, though the camcorder's batteries are also drained when night
  vision is used. Unlike the first game, Langermann's status as a cameraman
  means he has a much more advanced camera in his possession, one with clearer
  footage, zoom, and an audio detection system built into each speaker that can
  be used to detect distant footsteps and other noises but the camera is also
  equipped with an inventory system displaying the amount of footage they
  recorded. Spare batteries suitable for the camcorder are spread throughout
  the locations. Langermann also wears glasses, which limits the player's
  vision if they fall off.

developer: Ultra Runaway Games
publisher: Ultra Runaway Games
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Paper Sorcerer is a turned-based fantasy role-playing game, with a noticeable
  art style of completely hand drawn ink and pencil graphics.
  .
  The player takes the role of a sorcerer, once defeated by the four heroes of the
  king and now is attempting to break free from captivity with the help of an
  unknown ally. After the player escapes the cell room, the player now has ability
  to summon a creature to serve as a party member.
  .
  Summoned creatures have different physical combat and/or magic skills in
  addition to a limited selection of weapons, armor, and accessories they can
  equip. A werewolf for example, cannot equip any weapons (uses claws instead) and
  may only use light armor. A skeleton however, can equip longswords as well as
  light, medium, and heavy armor. As the game progresses, the player may summon
  additional creatures once a floor level has been completed. Only one creature
  type may be summoned in the party with up to a maximum of four party members,
  including the player.
  .
  Combat\n
  Turned based combat occurs when the player moves into range of an enemy, who are
  viewable while travelling. There are no random encounters. The party members,
  depending on their skills have a wide range of options, such as a normal attack,
  defending, and using a special skill or magic, both of which requires energy to
  use. Energy is regenerated by 1 per turn (or more if using a skill).
  .
  Defense is also a factor during combat, as a higher defense will thwart any
  direct damage to health. The amount of damage sustained once the defense is
  gone, is considerably high, although there are summoned creatures that have
  abilities to support the party's defense. Magic may ignore defense, however at
  half the damage.

developer: Ice-pick Lodge
publisher: Meridian 4
genre: Adventure;Horror
description:
  A Russian town, isolated for years from the surrounding influences of
  technology, finds itself subject to a terrible plague. The player controls one
  of three potential saviors, a government agent sent to the village (The
  Bachelor), an undertaker's son who has come to take over the business from his
  father (The Haruspex), and a young woman with mystical healing powers (The
  Devotress); the latter can only be played after having completed the game using
  one of the other characters. The three scenarios feature completely different
  missions, though their storylines are connected to each other.
  .
  Pathologic is a hybrid adventure game that incorporates elements of the
  role-playing and survival horror genres. The game world is viewed from a
  first-person perspective at all times. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to the
  exploration of the large town and conversations with its eccentric inhabitants,
  who will give the protagonist missions. Taking a cue from RPG quest design, some
  of these missions are entirely optional, while others serve the main storyline
  and trigger other quests.
  .
  The survival horror angle is emphasized by the various statistics the player
  should pay attention to. The protagonists get hungry and tired, so acquiring
  food and resting from time to time is essential. The protagonists can also
  become infected by the mysterious disease, which is demonstrated by a
  corresponding status bar; medications of various kinds must be applied to lessen
  or cure the infection. The game has a precise internal clock, and its characters
  might change their locations regardless of the player's input, which makes some
  of the quests time-based. Completing the main quests, however, is only one of
  the requirements for reaching the best ending; the game's time will advance and
  events will occur even if the player character sleeps through the whole game
  (provided he/she has enough food for that time). The town must be saved in 12
  days (game time); failure to do so will trigger one of the "bad" endings". The
  player is able to make moral decisions concerning saving characters or following
  one of the several leading groups in the game.
  .
  Combat in the game is action-based, following the FPS format. However, to
  emphasize the survival angle, all the three protagonists are rather clumsy and
  not particularly efficient in combat, and ammunition is scarce. Knives and other
  melee weapons can be used, as well as various guns. Weapons and clothes will
  become damaged and deteriorate; however, certain types of characters in the game
  will be able to fix them. Obligatory combat is rare in the game, though the
  player can kill any of the town's inhabitants, break into their houses, or fight
  criminals at night.
  .
  Economy and trading systems occupy an important portion of the gameplay. Prices
  in the shops will rise or fall depending on the current situation in the town.
  It is possible to sell any items the player finds in the game; however, another
  option is to trade them with the characters that roam the town. Depending on the
  character type, various trade possibilities are available, such as for example
  trading beads or needles that can be sometimes found in trash bins for valuable
  ammunition.

  (provided he/she has enough food for that time). The town must be saved in 12
  days (game time); failure to do so will trigger one of the "bad" endings". The
  player is able to make moral decisions concerning saving characters or following
  one of the several leading groups in the game.
  .
  Combat in the game is action-based, following the FPS format. However, to
  emphasize the survival angle, all the three protagonists are rather clumsy and
  not particularly efficient in combat, and ammunition is scarce. Knives and other
  melee weapons can be used, as well as various guns. Weapons and clothes will
  become damaged and deteriorate; however, certain types of characters in the game
  will be able to fix them. Obligatory combat is rare in the game, though the
  player can kill any of the town's inhabitants, break into their houses, or fight
  criminals at night.
  .
  Economy and trading systems occupy an important portion of the gameplay. Prices
  in the shops will rise or fall depending on the current situation in the town.
  It is possible to sell any items the player finds in the game; however, another
  option is to trade them with the characters that roam the town. Depending on the
  character type, various trade possibilities are available, such as for example
  trading beads or needles that can be sometimes found in trash bins for valuable
  ammunition.

description:
  Postal 2 is the sequel to Postal, the gritty, violent, over-the-top game that
  was the target of almost every politician's speech about violence in video
  games. Once again, the player takes on the role of Postal Dude, a normal
  (comparatively normal, anyway) guy living in Paradise, Arizona. The game is
  composed of a five day week, Monday to Friday, where the player must accomplish
  various errands. There is no time limit and errands can be done whenever the
  player feel like it. Errands range from getting a carton of milk (buying it or
  stealing it, player's choice) to cashing a cheque at the bank (either wait in
  line or kill everyone, again, player's choice). The game is as violent as you
  are, meaning the player can go through the majority of the game without killing
  someone or beating up someone, but can also go through it killing and
  decapitating every one the player comes across.
  .
  For killing needs, the player has a plethora of ways to dispatch people: kick
  them, urinate on them (making them vomit), shoot them, bash them with a shovel,
  throw gas on them and set them ablaze, leaving behind a charred corpse, and if
  the player wants to be stealthy, it is possible to pick up a cat and stick a
  shotgun into its rear end to use it as a silencer. One of the similarly over the
  top weapons is a decapitated cow's head filled with anthrax, which will cause
  everyone in the immediate area to gag, throw up, and eventually die.

developer: Introversion Software
publisher: Introversion
genre: Construction and Management Simulation
description:
  Build and Manage A Maximum Security Prison.
  .
  Prison Architect is the world's latest Prison Management Sim. Starting with an
  empty plot of land you must construct a holding cell with basic water and
  electricity to house your first batch of prisoners, to buy you enough time to
  create a proper cell block. You'll need to hire some guards, get some showers
  built and unless the kitchen is up and running with chefs working away you're
  going to end up with a riot on your hands. From there you take your prison in
  which-ever direction you like. A monsterous super-max or comfortable center for
  rehabilitation, the choice is up to you.
  .
  .
  Prison Architect is currently in Alpha which means that the game is playable,
  but still in development. Not all features are implemented yet and there are
  many bugs that may affect gameplay. We are currently releasing monthly updated
  builds which include new features and bug fixes. By buying the alpha you will
  automatically be gifted a free copy of the full game when it's finished.

  Game Description
  .
  Shortly after landing on an alien surface, you learn that hundreds of your men
  have been reduced to just a few. Now you must fight your way through heavily
  fortified military installations, lower the city's defenses and shut down the
  enemy's war machine. Only then will the fate of humanity be known.
  .
  About Quake II RTX
  .
  Quake II RTX builds on the work of Christoph Schied and the team at the
  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who added ray tracing to Quake II to create
  Q2VKPT (in turn building upon the Q2PRO code base). NVIDIA has introduced new
  path-traced visual effects, has improved texturing, and has made dozens of other
  changes and improvements, resulting in an experience that rivals games created
  today, and pushes your RTX hardware to the limit.
  .
  Quake II RTX is fully ray-traced and includes the 3 levels from the original
  shareware distribution.
  .
  Purchase Quake II: Quad Damage to access all levels from the base game as well
  as multiplayer support.

  hand at the NoTAV protests in Italy. He created the game to tell the stories and

  officer feel like during the conflict? RIOT - Civil Unrest presents the player
  with the opportunity to experience both sides of the fight - a fight in which
  there really are no winners. Who is right and who is wrong? Experience RIOT -
  Civil Unrest and draw your own conclusions.

developer: Gremlin Interactive

genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Puzzle;Shooter
description:
  Realms of the Haunting is a combination of first-person shooter and
  three-dimensional adventure game with quite a bit of live-action Full Motion
  Video thrown in to boot. Navigation through the game world is done through a FPS
  interface very similar to Doom; however there's also a free-floating cursor
  controlled by the mouse which you can use to interact with the various objects
  around you. There's also an inventory system and quite a few object related
  puzzles. The game has standard Doom-ish combat against a variety of monsters,
  however the combat is placed at intervals rather than throughout the game, and
  the emphasis is more on exploration and atmosphere.
  .
  The game's plot starts out as a typical haunted house story but soon mutates
  into an end-of-the-world tale combining New Age pseudo-philosophy and biblical

  Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical
  and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable
  twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to
  that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the
  character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances
  the terrifying atmosphere of the game.
  .
  .
  The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who
  reaches Richard Felton's house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of
  a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care
  of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary's true intentions, the
  dread begins.

  While investigating the activities of the SS Paranormal Division in Germany,
  B.J. Blazkowicz and Agent One have been captured by the Nazis. Agent One dies
  while being interrogated, but B.J. manages to escape Castle Wolfenstein's
  dungeon. He then fights his way out of the castle and uses a tram car to leave
  the area and meet up with a member of the German resistance in a nearby village.
  .
  The SS Paranormal Division under Oberfhrer Helga von Bulow has been excavating
  the catacombs and crypts of an ancient church within the village. Their sloppy
  precautions have led to the awakening of hordes of undead creatures, including
  Saxon knights, and the entrance had to be sealed off with many soldiers trapped
  inside. B.J. descends regardless and fights both Nazis and Undead until he
  arrives at the ancient "Defiled Church" where Nazi scientist Professor Zemph is
  conducting a "life essence extraction" on the corpse of a Dark Knight. Shortly
  before B.J.'s arrival, Zemph tries to talk Helga von Bulow out of retrieving an
  ancient Thulian dagger, but she shoots him impatiently and proceeds. This
  awakens a monster which kills her too. Blazkowicz fights the monster and is
  airlifted out, with Zemph's notes and the dagger.

genre: Strategy;Building;Survival

  Full version of The Riftbreaker is available here
  .
  The Riftbreaker Prologue allows you to experience the events taking place before
  the story campaign of the main game. Explore an entirely new world. Gather
  resources. Build up a base. Defend yourself from thousands of alien creatures.
  .
  You play the role of captain Ashley S. Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite
  scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to
  Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with
  the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and
  further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls "Mr. Riggs", can
  withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of
  equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of
  course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space
  across vast distances.
  .
  BASE BUILDING
  .
  Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex
  invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a
  few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain
  of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this
  mission.
  .
  EXPLORATION
  .
  Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy.
  Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for
  colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be
  found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with
  unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local
  outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources
  using rift technology .
  .
  DEFENSE
  .
  Your presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up your
  industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you as a
  threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers and defense towers as
  the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands of
  hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence.
  .
  HACK, SLASH, SHOOT
  .
  Mr. Riggs can be equipped with powerful weapons and abilities that will allow
  you to take on the largest of beasts. You will need to be ready to face lots of
  hostile alien creatures as you scout the planet.
  .
  GATHER SAMPLES AND STRANGE ARTIFACTS
  .
  Fallen beasts will drop valuable research specimens as well as rare resources.
  Use everything that you can gather to research and craft new technologies,
  buildings, weapons, and equipment. You can also scout the terrain using your
  sensors and dig for treasure buried underground.
  .
  RESEARCH
  .
  Use the samples that you've gathered to research new technologies that will help
  you build up your base, improve your defenses, develop new blueprints for your
  Mecha-suit or improve existing technologies.
  .
  CRAFT
  .
  Mr. Riggs is fully customizable and upgradeable. Use the blueprints that you've
  researched to craft new parts and weapons. Utilizing better materials for the
  crafting process results in developing gear with improved properties. Each
  crafted item has unique properties.
  .
  INTERACTIVE STREAMING
  .
  The Riftbreaker(tm) has built-in integration with the most popular streaming
  services out there. The stream's audience can actively participate in the game
  through multiple options, e.g. by voting to send waves of new enemies, spawn
  environmental disasters like a tornado or by donating resources .

game: Rise of the Triad - Dark War (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/R/Rise of the Triad - Dark War (USA)/Rise of the Triad - Dark War (USA).json
developer: Apogee Software, Ltd.
publisher: Apogee Software, Ltd.
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  A madman with power to kill millions has been discovered, and HUNT (High-risk
  United Nations Taskforce) has been dispatched to discover his plans. Your team
  was infiltrating his island stronghold when everything went to hell. The
  infiltration boat exploded and fire came from all directions. The only way out
  is in, into the the fortress, but to stay out here would be certain death. So in
  you go, guns blazing...
  .
  Rise of the Triad, a first-person shooter, is the successor of Wolfenstein 3D,
  with a somewhat improved 3D engine. Everything is still composed from blocks,
  but multiple vertical levels have been added; there are stairs made of platforms
  floating in air, and jump pads which launch you (and the enemies) high up so
  that you can walk over tall barriers in your way.
  .
  The game offers a lot of weapons. You begin with a pistol, but later you can
  find an extra pistol for John Woo-style shooting, and a MP40 rifle. All these
  weapons have unlimited ammo. You can also find more potent weapons - from
  classic rocket launcher, to quite wacky contraptions such as a "drunk missile"
  launcher or the "Excalibat", a powerful baseball bat. However, you can carry
  only one such a strong weapon at a time, and they have limited ammo.
  .
  Enemies are mostly humans equipped with various weapons. Their attacks can be
  quite varied; some of them can steal your weapons (though you can retrieve them
  after killing them), other shoot nets at you that trap you (you have to wriggle
  out, unless you found a knife, which will allow you to cut your way out). Apart
  from enemies, you'll be endangered by fireball launchers, rolling boulders and
  crushing walls.
  .
  There's a lot of power-ups you can pick up. They all have various wacky effects:
  for example, "God Mode" makes you immortal and allows you to toss homing,
  insta-death missiles; "Dog Mode" turns you into a... dog, which can fit into
  small spaces (and is inexplicably invulnerable to weapons); "Shrooms Mode" makes
  everything shine with bright colours, as if you were on drugs; "Elasto Mode"
  makes you very prone to bouncing off walls when you run into them.
  .
  ROTT also offers a lot of multi-player game modes; there's the standard
  deathmatch and "Capture the Triad", but there are also more varied modes - e.g.
  in "Collector" the players have no weapons, instead trying to collect as many
  "triads" as possible; in "Deluder", the players earn points by destroying
  "eluders" which move around the level.

genre: Adventure
description:
  After the Stranger has rescued Atrus, the master of linking books, from the
  imprisonment caused by his sons, a new task awaits the hero. Atruss wife,
  Catherine, has been taken by Gehn, his own father. Gehn has appointed himself as
  the one to rule the Age of Riven, and has driven his world to collapse. Now he
  holds Catherine hostage on Riven, hoping that his son will restore the book link
  to the Age and free him from there. The Stranger is requested by Atrus to travel
  to Riven and find a way to rescue Catherine.
  .
  Riven is a sequel to Myst, and is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay
  style, controls, and visual presentation. The game world is presented as a
  series of computer-generated still screens; the player explores it in a
  point-and-click fashion. Interaction with the environment is possible only when
  said environment is highlighted as a hot spot, and is also performed by simple
  clicking. Like its predecessor, Riven is heavy on puzzles, which rarely include
  using inventory items, but usually involve understanding and manipulating the
  complex environments and machinery of the game world.

publisher: Strategy First, Inc.
genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Hack-and-slashers tread carefully through the lands of Sacred, where the world
  itself is threatened by a veritable host of demons, set loose by a powerful but
  misguided sorcerer. A combat-driven adventure in the basic style of the popular
  Diablo games, Sacred offers a number of enhancements and unusual features that
  are new to the realm of action-RPGs. Players choose from six distinct character
  types, all with significantly different abilities as well as their own
  storylines and starting locations. These heroes can learn to ride horses and
  string together power combination attacks, and some may behave very differently
  as the game world cycles from day to night.
  .
  Playable characters include the burly gladiator, the agile wood elf, and the
  sneaky dark elf, as well as the angelic seraphim, the versatile battlemage, and
  the vampire, who appears as a noble knight during the day but commands the
  powers of her undead legacy at night. The world of Sacred is designed to
  encourage open exploration and freestyle progression, as the majority of the
  game's areas are accessible to player characters from the start. Each town in
  the game world is designed to have its own personality and player missions;
  characters who manage to accomplish all of a town's missions become true heroes
  there. Graphics feature 3D-rendered characters against hand-painted backgrounds,
  with three zoom levels.

developer: Volition Inc.
publisher: Deep Silver
genre: Action;Adventure
description:
  Kinzie has birthday and the whole Saints Row crew celebrates! Matt brought a
  Ouija board, but unfortunately it calls Satan and drags the Boss into Hell. Gat
  and Kinzie follow them to rescue their leader. There they'll meet old
  acquaintances (e.g. Dane Vogel and Dex) and historical figures (e.g. Shakespeare
  and Blackbeard).
  .
  Saints Row: Gat out of Hell is an add-on sized successor to Saints Row IV. The
  main difference to the main game is the lack of story missions - the plot
  progresses by doing enough side missions. When enough chaos is created, a
  cutscene starts and a new side mission type gets unlocked. After the third
  cutscene, the player is ready to face the end boss. Other major differences are
  the city (Hell is new, but smaller in scope than Steelport), the lack of
  customization (the player either controls Gat or Kinzie) and no licensed music.
  .
  Character development is identical to Saints Row IV except that new super powers
  are unlocked by finding and activating altars and flying works a bit different:
  Kinzie/Gat don't hover like Superman, but have giant wings. This causes them to
  slow down over time until they flap. They start with one flap per flight, but
  this number can be upgraded. While most distractions are known from the
  predecessor (but re-designed to fit the scenario), a few of them are new, e.g.
  shutting down factories by fighting over three control points. The four
  available activities are hellblazing (a flying checkpoint race), torment fraud
  (a insurance fraud variant), mayhem (causing chaos with a given weapon/vehicle)
  and salvation (husks fall from the sky and have to be collected by the flying
  player before they reach the ground).

file: Roms/Computer/GOG/S/Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves (USA)/Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves (USA).json
developer: Artifice Studios
publisher: Artifice Studios
genre: Action;Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  The story takes place during the month of December in 1858 in 19th century
  Canada. Two feuding brothers must come together to save their sister from being
  possessed by the Devil. The writing is inspired by traditional Quebec and Innu
  folklore with story contributions by fictional writer Bryan Perro.
  .
  Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves is a blend of action and strategy around
  defending a cabin. It requires the player to plan ahead and then use quick
  reflexes to clean up the scenario. Through the clever and skillful use of traps
  in some scenarios close combat can be avoided. If close combat is required a
  rifle, an axe and your fear factor can be used to deal with enemies.
  .
  Players choose one of the two brothers that represent the games two levels of
  difficulty. The normal difficulty has Joseph with proficiency in close combat
  and setting traps and the hard difficulty has Jack with a dependency on
  strategic trap setting. The strategy elements occur at the beginning of each day
  where through a bird's eye view of the area surrounding the main cabin the
  predictive waves of enemies and their travel paths can be observed. This enables
  you to place traps to intercept and hopefully destroy approaching enemies.
  Enemies that reach your buildings will attack and eventually destroy them.
  .
  It includes a gameplay mechanic called fear factor where sources of light and
  shouting are some ways to increase an enemy's fear for you. The less an enemy
  fears you the more likely they are to get close and subsequently attack.
  Watching this mechanic closely is essential for crowd control if attacked by a
  large group of enemies. The game offers 20 scenarios, each taking place once a
  day between December 5th, and December 24th. The game comes with full English
  and French voice acting.

developer: Valkyrie Studios
publisher: TopWare Interactive
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Septerra is a world which is composed of "layers" - continents that spin around
  the planet center. In the center is the Core, a kind of a living computer.
  According to the legends, the Creator of Septerra left there a precious Gift -
  an artifact that grants the one who possesses it legendary powers. Septerra is
  controlled by the Chosen, who live at the top of the world, consuming massive
  amounts of energy and throwing the "waste" down, to lower levels. Maya, a "junk
  scavenger" who lives among those wastes and earns the living collecting junk,
  unexpectedly comes into contact with the Chosen. It appears that their goal is
  to reach the legendary Gift. Maya and her friends decide to face the Chosen, and
  ultimately discover the true history of the planet.
  .
  Despite its Western origins, Septerra Core is a Japanese-style role-playing
  game. The game's visual design is close to Japanese anime, and the emphasis of
  the game is on a character-driven linear narrative with simple role-playing
  mechanics. The game's story evolves across the seven worlds of Septerra, each
  with its own distinct style, including post-apocalyptic, semi-medieval,
  futuristic, etc. In the first half of the game the player-controlled party
  explores these worlds on foot, accessing towns and other areas from an
  overworld. Later the player gains a ship that allows fast transportation to any
  world, including previously inaccessible areas.
  .
  Combat is turn-based and takes place against enemies who either visibly wander
  around or appear at pre-set locations in hostile areas. There are no enemies on
  the world map. The action bar of each character is divided into three segments
  and is gradually filled. Opting for either fast and weak or strong and slow
  attacks, the player must select a character in real time, stopping the bar and
  pausing combat. Magic spells are usually awarded after completing plot events
  and may be combined with each other by two or three characters to create new
  ones. The player is for the most part free to form a party of three active
  combatants from a larger cast.

  - Shadow Warrior (base game)\n
  Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter similar in style and gameplay to Duke
  Nukem 3D. The game set in a generic "Asialand", which looks like China and Japan
  conflated together. It features deliberately immature and politically incorrect
  humor, as well as a protagonist who delivers regular one-liners, commenting upon
  the situation at hand. Much of the humor is derived from over-the-top,
  stereotypical portrayals of Asian culture (e.g. scantily clad young women drawn
  in Japanese anime style).
  .
  - Twin Dragon (expansion)\n
  Twin Dragon was one of two authorized add-on packs for Shadow Warrior that were
  canceled during development and later released as freeware.  It features a
  completely new single player episode consisting of 13 levels, three new
  Wang-Bang levels and more.
  .
  - Wanton Destruction (expansion)\n
  Wanton Destruction is one of two authorized add-on packs for Shadow Warrior that
  were canceled during development and later released as freeware.  It adds three
  new Wang Bang-levels, a Capture The Flag-level and a new episode: Wanton
  Destruction. This episode features twelve new maps; also, some enemies now have
  different graphics.

  Shores Unknown: Arrival is a free demo which offers save data carry-over to the
  full game. Arrival sees you at the end of your trek to the northernmost shore in
  the Empire, searching for the reason why you were sent to such a remote village.
  Problems arise when visitors of unknown origin are spotted through the distant
  fog that blankets the sea, and soon you find yourself under threat from the
  dreaded Inquisition.
  .
  A turn-based tactical RPG rendered in a rich, low-poly aesthetic. Build your own
  team of mercenaries, forge alliances, wage battles, and journey beyond the
  seething wall of fog known only as the Murk in this decision-influenced,
  narrative-driven adventure. What dangers await you on Shores Unknown?

  THE SHORES BECKON
  .
  Shores Unknown takes place in a land ruled by the iron-fisted Crown, and policed
  by the fearsome Inquisition, from whom it is said there is no escape. To the
  south lies the Empire and perpetual war, while to the north there is only the
  Murk -- a seething wall of fog from which no ship has ever returned. In the
  midst of these grand forces, both natural and otherwise, our heroes must find a
  way to survive and to pursue their dreams of liberty.
  .
  Play as the newly-made leader of a mercenary company, fresh off an assignment
  gone awry. Now on the wrong side of the Crown, allies and loyalty are paramount.
  Forced to venture through the maw of the Murk in a search for truth, players
  will explore unknown lands, forge new alliances, and wage battle against those
  who would see to their end. What dangers await on Shores Unknown?
  .

developer: Firaxis Games
publisher: 2K Games
genre: Construction and Management Simulation;Strategy
description:
  Sid Meier's Civilization III is a turn-based strategy game where the objective
  is to rule the planet with the civilization of the player's choice. Players
  control one of 15 historic civilizations (Aztecs, Egyptians, Russians, etc).
  Each civilization has its own particular strengths and weaknesses -- some are
  more scientific, for example, while others have stronger cultural or military
  attributes; also, each civilization has its own unique unit, and is more prone
  to certain forms of government while shunning some others.
  .
  Like in the previous titles in the series, the point of the game is to expand
  the influence of a civilization through resource management, conquest, or trade
  with other civilizations. As game time progresses from ancient times through the
  modern era, a civilization will acquire new technologies, which in turn enable
  interesting new abilities and enhanced power. Since there are several ways to
  win (military, diplomatic, or cultural), it is up to each player to determine
  how best to manage the division of labor.
  .
  The game includes some mechanics and features which were introduced in Sid
  Meier's Alpha Centauri, such as borders between civilizations and the
  aforementioned differences between each civilization's statistics. The advisors
  are now present in the upper right corner of the screen in relevant menus.
  Diplomacy has been expanded, with the ability to trade and even slightly haggle
  with other civilizations in a more detailed way. Other new additions include the
  great leader mechanic, war weariness amongst the population, and small wonders.

  Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is available here
  .
  THESE WALLS CAN'T FALL
  .
  Set in the medieval world of Gloria Victis, Siege Survival: Gloria Victis sees
  your country invaded and your city under brutal siege.
  .
  A small group of civilians are trapped in the only remaining stronghold and are
  the last source of hope for the defending troops hanging on for dear life. You
  might not be fighting the invaders yourself, but the fate of the city lies in
  your hands.
  .
  Support the last soldiers standing against overwhelming enemy forces and hold
  out until reinforcements arrive. Build your camp, manage resources, craft
  supplies during the day and scour the fallen city for resources and new civilian
  recruits at night.
  .
  SURVIVE THE SIEGE
  .
  Defending what's left of your city are a few tired troops in dire need of
  arrows, weapons and armour; along with treatment for the wounded. You need to
  keep this last bastion of defenders supplied and supported in every way possible
  ahead of their battles every few days; otherwise, the enemy will eventually
  storm the keep. Not only that, but you also need to protect your civilians and
  your camp, as you are assaulted by waves of flaming arrows and giant boulders.
  .
  MANAGE RESOURCES & CRAFT SUPPLIES
  .
  You need better weapons, a roof over your head, hot food and all the other
  trappings that just existing entail; and the only way you'll get these is if you
  and your team craft them. But resources are limited and you'll need to sustain
  both soldiers and civilians, so find ways to preserve food, develop your
  infrastructure and use your supplies more efficiently.
  .
  SCAVENGE THE FALLEN CITY
  .
  Venturing out from the safety of your keep, you have to explore the ransacked
  city at night to collect precious resources and help the surviving citizens - or
  exploit them. But be careful, enemy patrols keep watching the streets; you must
  be smart to remain unseen... and alive. Unlock routes to other districts, enlist
  new civilian recruits and make it back before dawn so as not to be caught.
  .
  YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL
  .
  Help is coming, but it's weeks away. And in a siege like this, one dilemma can
  quickly spiral into another and very soon you will face tough moral choices. The
  fate of your companions - and that of the city - is in your hands alone. There
  will be hunger, wounds, disease and despair, but also growing tensions between
  the civilians and defenders. Sustain your troops or keep your civilians alive?
  Only you can decide.
  .
  TELL YOUR OWN STORY
  .
  Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is developed on a game editor platform that will
  allow modding and community-generated content at launch. Create your own unique
  scenarios and stories from scratch and expand the universe of Gloria Victis.

genre: Action;Adventure;Horror
description:
  Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience: its antagonist, the
  supernatural entity known only as The Presence, is controlled by an advanced AI
  (Artificial Intelligence) that adapts to your actions and decisions. Experience
  unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and
  hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player
  and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted
  sequences.
  .
  As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of
  characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different,
  and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to
  approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the
  world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some
  will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can
  die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will
  have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so
  their deaths are not in vain.

description:
  As the Starfleet Lieutenant Alexander Munro returns to Alpha Quadrant from a
  long voyage, the authorities consider the Hazard Team that he had commanded an
  unnecessary luxury, disbanding it and assigning Munro to teach small unit
  tactics at the Starfleet Academy. Two years later, Captain Picard contacts Munro
  and offers him to reassemble the Hazard Team on board his space ship, the USS
  Enterprise. Shortly afterwards, the ship receives a distress call from USS
  Dallas. Apparently, members of a mysterious alien race known as the Exomorphs
  have attacked the ship. As Munro is sent to rescue the crew members, he is
  reunited with an old friend, and has to face dangers graver than anything he has
  encountered so far...
  .
  Star Trek: Elite Force II is a sequel to Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force. It is
  set in the Star Trek universe, chronologically overlapping with the last
  episodes of the Star Trek: Voyager series. Like its predecessor, it is a first-
  person shooter in which the player controls Alexander Munro (who can only be
  male in this sequel), who is usually aided by his AI-controlled teammates during
  exploration of the levels and combat.
  .
  Munro has fifteen weapons at his disposal, most of which have been ported from
  the previous game. Most of these futuristic, Star Trek-themed weapons are energy
  guns that have alternate firing mode. The tricorder reappears with a new
  function: the player must now actively use it in order to bypass security,
  participating in a power-routing mini-game, during which it is necessary to
  connect two nodes by manipulating a series of pipes.
  .
  During certain scripted events, the player can choose between two or more
  responses to a particular situation. These choices may affect the subsequent
  events and the level progression. There is also a possibility of a romantic
  involvement with one of the two female teammates.

game: Star Wars - Dark Forces (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/S/Star Wars - Dark Forces (USA)/Star Wars - Dark Forces (USA).json
developer: LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Action
description:
  Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the
  Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility,
  he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base.
  This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various
  iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and
  firepower to turn the tide of the war. Dark Forces is a close prequel to the
  original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to
  enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine,
  like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi
  engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to
  look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark
  Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional
  appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or
  picking him up from each mission. Most levels have a fairly complex, often
  maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to
  change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as
  certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can
  use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark
  areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The
  player character is given a certain amount of "lives" per level; he dies
  permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only
  between missions. The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to
  disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from
  the Star Wars movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to
  Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to
  most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for
  Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to
  planting charges around a facility to demolish it. Cutscenes appear between key
  missions to update the plot. The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, as the
  game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen
  in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as
  weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark
  Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action
  scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams'
  original film score. The game is entirely a single-player campaign; no
  multiplayer is included or supported.

genre: Action;Adventure;Shooter
description:
  Kyle Katarn, a former mercenary and now an ally of the rebels, discovers that he
  is in fact a Jedi, and is on a quest to find his lightsaber and learn the
  techniques of the Force. The evil Sith lord Jerec, who was responsible for the
  death of Kyle's father, is on a quest of his own, searching a mythical place
  called Valley of the Jedi, where his dark powers could be unleashed. Will Kyle
  be able to stop Jerec and become a true Jedi without falling to the dark side?
  .
  Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II is a sequel to Dark Forces. The game is
  set in the Star Wars universe and its events occur after those depicted in the
  movie Return of the Jedi (Episode VI). Primarily a first-person 3D shooter, the
  game also allows the player to switch to third-person perspective. Kyle can use
  blasters and rifles to take care of his enemies, and later in the game he will
  also be able to fight enemies with a lightsaber.
  .
  There are three kinds of Force powers Kyle may use in the game: light, dark and
  neutral. Light powers are mostly used for healing purposes; dark powers involve
  violent actions such as choking enemies or hurling objects at them; neutral
  powers enhance Kyle's speed and jumping ability. There are fourteen Force powers
  altogether; if the player chooses to develop only one type of powers throughout
  the game, a bonus power can be gained. Completing levels rewards the player with
  stars, which can be allocated to enhance the powers.
  .
  The game has a branching storyline with different endings, and the player's
  decisions can lead Kyle to the light as well as the dark side (for example,
  killing innocents will add "dark points" to Kyle's score). The game features
  video sequences with live actors as cutscenes.

file: Roms/Computer/GOG/S/Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic (USA)/Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic (USA).json
developer: BioWare
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Four thousand years before the events depicted in the Star Wars movies, the
  political and ideological situation is not much different from what we have seen
  in the prequel trilogy: the Republic and the Jedi Order are fighting against two
  powerful Sith lords, Darth Revan and his apprentice, Darth Malak. It is said
  that the former was successfully defeated by the Jedi, and that Darth Malak
  betrayed his mentor and is planning to take on the Republic by himself. His
  aggression is so successful that some Jedi have decided to join his ranks. A
  seemingly ordinary soldier of the Republic is traveling aboard a space ship that
  is attacked by Darth Malak's minions. Narrowly escaping, the soldier meets a
  female Jedi named Bastila, one of those who have fought Darth Revan in the
  decisive battle. With her help, the soldier must learn to become a Jedi, stop
  Darth Malak, and discover the truth about his or her own past.
  .
  Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing game that uses the Star Wars D20
  rule system, which is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
  Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous
  RPGs such as Baldur's Gate series. Combat engine follows similar "real-time with
  pause" rules. There are only three active combatants on the player's side (as
  opposed to six in Baldur's Gate). Several characters join the party and can be
  switched at the player's will.
  .
  Eventually, the protagonist will have to train at the Jedi academy to earn a
  lightsaber and force moves. Force powers include stun, force pull (which pulls
  opponents or objects toward the player-controlled character), the Jedi Mind
  Trick, which persuades people to see things the player's way, and many others.
  The player has various weapons at his or her disposal, from the lightsaber to
  blasters, grenades, ion rifles, etc.
  .
  Throughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that
  appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees, the
  desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various
  ways and performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the
  forces of Light and Darkness. The player can turn the main character into a
  flawless Jedi, a ruthless Sith, or anything in between. Some of the player's
  choices influence major events that occur within the storyline.

developer: Obsidian
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Five years after the events depicted in Knights of the Old Republic, the Sith
  have become stronger and more determined to rule the Galaxy. The Jedi Order is
  nearly exterminated. A mysterious ex-Jedi has been exiled from the Order and is
  traveling alone. This Jedi had served under Darth Revan (when the latter was
  still on the Light side of the Force) during the Mandalorian Wars, but due to
  enigmatic circumstances was forced to retire. Now the past is catching up with
  the Jedi, and soon he or she will have to choose the side to fight on.
  .
  The Sith Lords looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, also being
  based on the Star Wars d20 role-playing rule set (which, in its turn, is similar
  to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons) and having the same combat engine,
  character development, and a Light and Dark ethical system, which judges the
  player's decisions and actions and influences story events and characters'
  responses. Additions to the gameplay include a lightsaber-crafting system, which
  allows augmenting lightsabers with various items, new Force powers, and the
  possibility to influence the alignments of the characters in the
  player-controlled party through conversation choices and other decisions. Most
  of the exploration and the combat sequences is done using a party of three,
  including the protagonist and two companions. However, certain parts of the game
  will force the player to travel alone, or to control a party made exclusively
  out of companions.
  .
  A large part of the military equipment can be upgraded using any workbench that
  can be found throughout the game world, including one available at all times on
  the ship that the player uses to travel between planetary systems. Different
  types of items have more than one piece that can be augmented. For example, the
  armor has two slots for upgrades (overlay and underlay), while ranged weapons
  have three (targeting, firing chamber, and power pack), and lightsabers have
  six. The easiest way to get additional upgrades is to either buy them or loot
  them, however they can be created as well at a workbench with the right
  components and enough repair skill. Medical items are a different sort and they
  can be crafted using lab stations.
  .
  At various moments during the game, the player has the opportunity to play some
  mini games: a card game called Pazaak, shooting targets using a turret from a
  first-person view, and swoop racing.

  The game's prologue (and tutorial) concerns Ace's "family missions" in which his

  .
  These missions reveal that the Azzameen family are in heated competition with
  the Viraxo and are generally sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. Due to their
  sympathies, the patriarch of the family, Tomaas Azzameen, smuggles bacta for the
  Alliance in the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth. This causes them to pay dearly
  as the Galactic Empire raids their home station for running bacta to an Alliance
  outpost. The family subsequently seeks asylum with a Rebel task force.
  .
  As a Rebel pilot, Ace participates in a variety of missions for the Rebellion
  while also helping his family fight the Viraxo. During his tour with the Rebel
  Alliance, he proves himself to be a significant pilot as he participates in
  missions that uncover new Imperial projects, such as experimental TIE fighters
  and the second Death Star.

description:
  Victoria McPherson, is a brilliant young FBI agent who's investigating a serial
  murder case. The body count is now at five and with the lack of real leads and a
  mountain of circumstantial evidence, Victoria is beginning to show signs of
  fatigue and stress.
  .
  She decides to take a break and go rest at her father's home in suburban
  Chicago; after all, it is close to the Christmas holidays. However, Victoria
  does not find rest. Instead, she finds one of her grandfather's old case files

  the past, right down to the killer's MO...

description:
  Who is hiding behind Mr. X? Still Life 2 reveals the long-awaited ending of
  Still Life and spells a new investigation for Agent Victoria McPherson.
  .
  .
  In Fall 2008, Victoria is sent to Maine where Ellen Dunnigan's body has just
  been found. The modus operandi and the video sent to the police and press leave
  them in no doubt as to the killer's identity: the East Coast Torturer has struck
  again! No clues are picked up during the autopsy, as the serial killer
  painstakingly washed the body. Once again, the killer has not committed any
  errors.
  .
  .
  From her motel room, Victoria comes across a report by Paloma Hernandez, the
  journalist covering all the crimes bearing the East Coast Torturer's signature.
  Hernandez has been highly critical of the FBI's and Victoria's lack of progress.
  That does not stop Hernandez from phoning and asking Victoria to meet her later
  that evening. Hernandez claims to have some so-called clues on the killer in her
  possession. Victoria flatly refuses. Just moments later, Paloma is kidnapped by
  the Torturer...
  .
  .
  Still Life 2 remains true to the spirit of its first installment, but now allows
  you to play and manage two characters bound by the same fate. This time, the aim
  is to control two heroines, see the game from two complementary viewpoints and
  experience two different gameplays. Depending on whether you are playing Paloma
  Hernandez, the victim being hunted by the killer or Victoria McPherson, the FBI
  agent tracking him down, you can alternate between survival and investigation.

  When the insane god Khull-Khuum was rampaging the world, devastating everything

  Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse is a 3D action game that turns the
  tables on the age old tradition of zombie games. In this game, you play as the
  zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains. Stubbs the Zombie is set in
  a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one
  day as he zombifies the entire city.
  .
  Before becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman
  in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's
  richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on
  top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's
  citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy
  scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.
  .
  Luckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie
  and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special
  body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his
  pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl
  it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand
  and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to
  take control of enemy humans and their weapons.

description:
  Syberia is a 2002 computer adventure game conceived by Benoît Sokal, developed
  by Microïds and published through The Adventure Company. It follows the
  protagonist Kate Walker as she attempts to wrap up a sale on the behalf of her
  law firm. In addition to the main plot, the game contains a dramatic subplot,
  conducted via calls received on Kate's cell phone, involving Kate's
  deteriorating relationship with her fiancé.
  .
  The game uses elements of art nouveau and steampunk fiction in its story. Most
  devices and tools, and even a train, are powered by springs and wind-up gears.
  Syberia was acclaimed by critics for its graphic design and intelligent script,
  and a sequel, Syberia II, was released in 2004, picking up where the first game
  leaves off. In 2009 Microïds announced that Syberia III would be released on PC,
  and possibly PlayStation 3, in 2010 or 2011.
  .
  Sokal's earlier game Amerzone is located in the same fictional universe, and
  Syberia contains some references to it. Another of Sokal's adventure games
  Paradise has no connections to Syberia but does use similar art direction and
  interface.

  Syberia II, like its predecessor, is a third-person, mouse-driven adventure game
  in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in
  order for the linear storyline to proceed. As a pure graphical adventure game,
  Syberia follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible
  to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to
  become fully immersed in Syberia's universe without the fear of making a mistake
  or the constant need to save the game.
  .
  Syberia II continues the adventures of American lawyer Kate Walker from the
  first game as she abandons her increasingly stressful life in New York in order
  to accompany an eccentric inventor to a remote land in Russia known as Syberia,
  where surviving remnants of prehistoric mammoths still live.

developer: Irrational Games
publisher: Electronic Arts
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Role-Playing;Shooter
description:
  In the year 2114, forty-two years after the events described in System Shock, a
  soldier joins the military organization Unified National Nominate (UNN),
  receiving the number G65434-2, and is shortly thereafter assigned to the
  military space ship Rickenbacker. This ship's duty is to escort the Von Braun,
  an experimental faster-than-light starship, on its maiden voyage. However, the
  next thing the soldier can remember is waking up in a cryo-tube on the Von
  Braun. It appears that both ships were infected with something so horrifying
  that nearly the entire crew was either killed or mutated into monsters. The
  soldier is contacted by a woman who identifies herself as the only human
  survivor. His first task is a rendezvous with this woman, for which he will have
  to traverse the monster-infested corridors of the ghost ship.
  .
  System Shock 2 is a hybrid of first-person shooter and role-playing game. In the
  beginning of the game the player chooses a career for the protagonist in the
  UNN. This choice grants bonuses to the protagonist's initial skills. Marines
  specialize in combat, navy officers can repair weapons and hack computer
  terminals, and OSA agents may begin the game with psionic powers.
  Notwithstanding this initial choice, the player may choose to learn any of these
  skills as the game progresses, spending acquired cybermodules to develop the
  main character in a RPG fashion.
  .
  As the hero traverses the corridors of Von Braun, he will have to avoid death at
  the hands of hostile creatures and robots on the way, acquire a variety of
  items, and complete missions to unlock new areas and advance the story. The game
  emphasizes survival rather than elimination of enemies; in many situations the
  protagonist is underpowered, and new enemies may appear in already explored
  areas.
  .
  Combat is done in FPS style, with both ranged and melee weapons. The ranged
  weapons can accept a few different types of ammo, each of them efficient against
  different foes, and can shoot in two firing modes. However, ranged weapons
  deteriorate quickly as the player character uses them, and will eventually break
  down after prolonged use.
  .
  Like in the first System Shock, much of the background story in the game is
  revealed by finding messages left by crew members before they fell victims to
  the mysterious infestation.

  follows the same design philosophy and gameplay structure that distinguished its
  predecessors. As before, stealth is the key to successful completion of
  missions. Avoiding confrontation with the guards, Garrett has to make his way
  through the levels towards the objective. Shadows and sounds play a large role,
  as guards will react to suspicious noises, and studying their patrolling
  routines is essential.
  .
  A few gameplay elements have been slightly altered. Garrett can no longer swim,
  but is able to use climbing gloves that attach him to the walls. He can also
  flatten himself against walls while standing; if in shadow, he remains
  completely unnoticeable that way. The player can see Garrett's limbs even if he
  is viewed from first-person perspective, allowing more precise movements.
  Switching to third-person view is also possible.
  .
  The most significant gameplay change is the non-linear exploration of the City,
  which has been added to the largely linear missions. In order to access the next
  mission, Garrett has to explore the City. On his way, he can overhear
  conversations, steal valuables, avoid or knock out the guards, and even accept
  secondary missions, which will influence his reputation with some of its
  factions.

game: Thief Gold (USA)
file: Roms/Computer/GOG/T/Thief Gold (USA)/Thief Gold (USA).json
developer: Looking Glass Studios
publisher: Square Enix
genre: Action;Adventure;Stealth
description:
  Thief Gold is a reissue of the game, Thief: The Dark Project, updated to version
  1.37. Thief Gold includes three entirely new campaign missions which deepen the
  plot and provide new challenges, as well as five new types of enemies to
  overcome. Some of the original Thief levels have had minor modifications, to
  include bugfixes, small design changes and the new enemies.
  .
  Garrett, discovered on the streets as a beggar, is taken in and trained by the
  secretive organization known as the Keepers. However, Garrett's plans for his
  training is different than that of his masters and so Garrett soon parts
  company. Surfacing as a master thief, Garrett must enter forbidden places and
  appropriate the treasures of the rich and the powerful. Of course this line of
  work is offensive to many people including the rich nobles, the town guard and
  the religious order of the Hammerites. If Garrett can keep his head while he
  relieves these forces of their valuable trinkets, he should be able to do quite
  well....
  .
  Thief: The Dark Project is a first person game focused on stealth. It is set in
  a metropolis called "the City", a medieval fantasy world with some elements from
  the industrial revolution era of technology. Garrett's main skills are in using
  the shadows to avoid being seen (the level of visibility indicated by a "light
  gem") and to avoid being heard (different surfaces make different noises).
  Guards can be alerted by either, and remaining hidden is ever important.
  Entering combat against armed opponents is not recommended, though some enemies
  (notably the various undead) can be taken on directly or avoided. It is also
  possible to silently sneak on guards, incapacitate them with the blackjack,
  steal their keys, and move their bodies.
  .
  At Garrett's disposal is a wide range of equipment, including lockpicks, a
  blackjack, a sword, flash bombs, holy water, explosive mines, and a bow which
  fires normal arrows in addition to water, fire, moss, rope, and noisemaker
  arrows. Each type of arrows has a unique purpose: water extinguishes torches,
  moss covers the ground to soften the sounds of footsteps, ropes can be used to
  climb in certain spots or cross chasms, etc.
  .
  The levels in the game are fairly open, and most of the time there are several
  paths and ways to accomplish the objective. Certain objects can be interacted
  with, moved from place to place, or destroyed. The game has three difficulty
  levels distinguished by the amount of goals needed to fulfill. Lower difficulty
  levels may allow the player to skip some of the harder areas due to the lack of
  a mission objective leading there. On higher difficulties, additional
  requirements (such as completely non-lethal way of finishing a stage) may be
  added. Loot gained from Garrett's thieving can be used to purchase additional
  equipment for the mission ahead.

  The story begins with Lara Croft's origins as a teenaged tomb raider,
  accompanied by her then mentor, Werner Von Croy. They travel to the temple of
  Angkor Wat, Cambodia in the hope of finding the mystical "Iris." However, the
  trip is cut short by an accident where Lara is forced to abandon her companion,
  whom she believes perished, in order to save her own life.
  .
  Back in the current year in which the game is set (1999), Lara finds herself in
  Egypt, Lara Croft uncovers an ancient tomb where a fearsome Egyptian God Set was
  once imprisoned. She unwittingly unleashes him and finds herself in a deadly
  race against time to restore the god to his resting place before an apocalypse
  befalls Earth.
  .
  Unfortunately, Von Croy becomes Lara's new rival as he is possessed by Set
  himself and he makes things considerably more difficult. Lara travels across
  Egypt to collect the pieces of Horus' armour in order to defeat Set. They are
  found in Pharos, Temple of Isis, Temple of Poseidon and Cleopatra's Palaces. She
  combines them (with the Amulet of Horus) in the Temple of Horus to finally
  defeat her enemy. However before Horus can be summoned, Set arrives and destroys
  the armour, knocking the amulet into the water. Lara quickly recovers it and
  exits the Temple sealing the entrance shut with the amulet. She must leave it in
  place to keep Set imprisoned for eternity. As she reaches the exit of the
  temple, injured and exhausted, she is confronted by Von Croy. Fearful that he
  may still be possessed she is reluctant to hold onto his outstretched hands and
  so she falls into the darkness beneath the collapsing temple.

description:
  Tomb Raider: Chronicles is set just days after the events of The Last
  Revelation. After the Temple of Horus had caved in, effectively entombing Lara,
  she is presumed dead.
  .
  A memorial service is held, soon after which Winston Smith and Father Patrick
  Dunstan reveal that Werner von Croy is excavating the dilapidated temple in the
  hope of discovering her alive. Later at Croft Manor, three old associates of
  Lara's - Winston Smith, Father Patrick Dunstan and Charles Kane - reminisce some
  of her past adventures.
  .
  The first of which is situated in Rome, where Lara is searching for the fabled
  Philosopher's Stone. Pierre DuPont and Larson Conway are reintroduced and we
  learn that they are, too, after the Stone.
  .
  The second adventure entails Lara on the hunt for the famed Spear of Destiny.
  She encounters a Mafioso gang leader, Mikhailov, who is also after the Spear.
  Lara retrieves the Spear from the Ocean floor but is apprehended by a couple of
  Mikhailov's men. She warns him not to use the Spear as he has no idea of the
  powers it could unleash. However, he disregards her warnings as desperate
  attempts to attain the Spear. Mikhailov is inflicted with its power and the
  submarine hull is breached. Lara escapes and leaves the Spear to rest.
  .
  The third adventure is set in Lara's childhood on Black Isle of Ireland. She's
  staying with Winston but overhears him and Father Patrick Dunstan conversing

  The fourth and final expedition involves Lara infiltrating a high-tech complex
  owned by none other than Werner von Croy in pursuit of the Iris artefact, an
  artefact Lara sees as her own from the beginning events of Tomb Raider: The Last

  where we see Werner von Croy excavating the collapsed temple. A young boy gets
  the attention of Werner and asks him to come and see. He follows. When he enters
  the tomb, he demands to see what they have found. It is Lara's backpack. He then
  declares: "We've found her!"

  Two friends, Gagwin and Baggus, along with Gagwin's son, went on a search for
  the 12 legendary treasures once gathered by the hero Huayin to defeat a demon.
  After gathering all treasures, they've arrived at an island with a temple which
  can only be opened by said treasures and which was said to hold great riches.
  The trio enters the temple and what happens next is yet to be revealed...
  .
  Treasure Adventure Game is a platform game developed as a tribute to 8-bit era
  games. The player controls the boy 10 years after he arrived at the island, when
  his adoptive grandmother sends him into an adventure: gather the same 12
  treasures as his father once did. The game features a huge side scrolling world
  comprised of several islands, which were once a single continent. The islands
  can be explored in a non-linear fashion, with new areas being made accessible by
  the collection of new items. The boy has a hook for a hand, and uses it as a
  weapon. He can crawl to cross lowered passages, jump and grab onto ledges and
  hanging vines or chains with his hook. When traveling from one island to
  another, he uses a boat, which can be latter equipped with a sail and a cannon.
  .
  Each treasure is hidden somewhere in the map, and the player must first find
  maps which will point to the right X and Y coordinates where they can be found.
  Using a compass, the player can travel precisely to those coordinates. Some
  other items are also hidden and can be found by the use of maps. Some maps and
  items are locked into chests, which will require lockpicks to be unlocked. Money
  can be collected and used to buy new items. The game also features a day and
  night cycle, with areas only being reachable in certain times of the day (such
  as a store which only opens from 5 to 16 and night club which only has shows at
  night).

  Trent Hawkings, this galaxy's ace solo fighter-pilot, whose luck forces him to
  save the galaxy, one time after another. Again and again, Trent must fight off
  MicroSol, a company with the evil intent of taking over the galaxy. Through your
  struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and
  allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you've
  already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further
  threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing
  MicroSol.
  .
  Tyrian also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play.
  It features a multi-layered ship upgrade engine, in which you can change hulls,
  decide upon and upgrade your front and rear weapons, buy better shields and
  generators and even add ship "sidekicks". Tyrian's complete arsenal amound to
  over a dozen type of ships and over 100 weapon types!

developer: Richard Garriott
publisher: Sierra Online, Inc.
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress, released on August 24, 1982 (USCO#
  PA-317-502), is the second role-playing video game in the Ultima series.
  .
  It was also the only official Ultima game published by Sierra On-Line.
  Controversy with Sierra over royalties for the PC port of this game led the
  series creator Richard Garriott to start his own company, Origin Systems.
  .
  The gameplay is very similar to the previous game in the series, Ultima. The
  scope of the game is bigger, in that there are several more places to explore,
  even though some of them (like most of the solar system planets and the dungeons
  and towers) are optional and not required to complete the game.
  .
  In the game, the player has to travel to several different time periods of
  Earth, using time doors. The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological
  period), Pangea (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, "before the
  dawn of civilization"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112).

developer: ORIGIN Systems, Inc.
publisher: ORIGIN Systems, Inc.
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Ultima III: Exodus is the third game in the Ultima series. Exodus is also the
  name of the game's principal antagonist. Released in 1983, it was the first
  Ultima game published by Origin Systems. Originally developed for the Apple II,
  Exodus was eventually ported to 13 other platforms, including a NES/Famicom
  remake.
  .
  Exodus featured revolutionary graphics for its time, as one of the first
  computer RPGs to display animated characters. Also, Exodus differs from previous
  games in that players now direct the actions of a party of four characters
  rather than just one. During regular play the characters are represented as a
  single player icon and move as one. However, in battle mode, each character is
  represented separately on a separate "battle screen" and the player alternates
  commands between each character in order, followed by each enemy character
  having a turn. Thus the player must understand weapons and magic commands and
  employ rudimentary tactics in order to overcome each opponent. This differs from
  the two previous games in the Ultima series in which the player is simply
  depicted as trading blows with one opponent on the main map until either is
  defeated. Enemies on the overworld map can be seen and at least temporarily
  avoided, while enemies in a dungeon may appear randomly without any forewarning.

  Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, first released in 1985 for the Apple II, is the
  fourth in the series of Ultima role-playing video games. It is the first in the
  "Age of Enlightenment" trilogy, shifting the series from the hack and slash,
  dungeon crawl gameplay of its "Age of Darkness" predecessors towards an
  ethically-nuanced, story-driven approach. In 1996 Computer Gaming World named
  Ultima IV as #2 on its Best Games of All Time list on the PC. Designer Richard
  Garriott considers this game to be among his favorites from the Ultima series.
  .
  Ultima IV is among the few computer role-playing games, and perhaps the first,
  in which the game's story does not center on asking a player to overcome a
  tangible ultimate evil.

  Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny (1988) is the fifth entry in the role-playing
  video game series Ultima.  After having mastered the eight Virtues, attaining
  Avatarhood and retrieving the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom in the previous game, the
  Avatar is summoned back to Britannia by his old comrades Iolo and Shamino using
  a magic coin, which was included as a trinket in the game's box. Upon arrival he
  is greeted by Shamino but they immediately come under attack from the three
  powerful beings known as the Shadowlords.
  .
  Warriors of Destiny featured much more polished writing (earlier games were
  riddled with some spelling errors and uneven vocabulary) and considerably
  greater detail than previous games. It was the first Ultima to implement a
  time-of-day system in which the sun rises and sets, and non-player characters
  follow daily routine schedules. This game has been lauded as realistically
  portraying a culture living under a dictatorial regime; its tone is much darker
  than that of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.

description:
  This re-release contains the original game "Ultima VII: Part Two - Serpent
  Isle", along with the expansion, "The Silver Seed."
  .
  This game takes place 18 months after Ultima VII: The Black Gate. Batlin, the
  leader of the Fellowship has disappeared, as well as Iolo's wife Gwenno. A map
  is found that points to the Serpent Isle where the Guardian is still planning to
  destroy Britannia. Lord British sends you, the Avatar, and your companions to
  this new land. Once there, you discover that a great imbalance is upon the isle
  and it is up to you to fix it. To do so, you must learn the philosophies of the
  original inhabitants of this land who worshiped giant serpents symbolizing the
  principles of Order, Chaos and Balance.
  .
  Serpent Isle uses virtually the same game engine as the first Ultima 7, with
  some slight modifications in inventory managment and NPC portraits. The story
  however, is more linear and also more extensive. In typical Ultima-style there's
  lots of dialogue with NPCs next to the usual fighting, puzzles and magic.
  .
  The Silver Seed was an add-in disk for Ultima VII, Part Two: Serpent Isle. It
  added a new scenario with 5 quests, in which the player has to go back in time
  to find the silver seed which would heal the lands. In order to fit in with the
  original story line, these quests needed to be completed before finishing the
  original game.
  .
  The main appeal of the game was a few useful items such as a key-ring for
  storing the many keys could be found and a few interface improvements such as
  new hotkeys.

  Ultima VIII: Pagan begins where Ultima VII: Part Two - Serpent Isle ended. The
  Guardian banishes the Avatar to the land of Pagan, a world under his control.
  Stranded in this unknown land, without his companions to help him, the Avatar's
  goal is to find a way back to Britannia. He has to confront four Titans in this
  world who are embodiments of the four elements, as well as master different
  styles of magic and fight many opponents on his way.

developer: ORIGIN Systems, Inc.
publisher: Electronic Arts, Inc.
genre: Action;Adventure;Role-Playing
description:
  For the last time, the Avatar is being summoned to free Britannia from
  Guardian's curse. The eight Shrines of Virtues, the pride of Britannia, have
  been all desecrated by this evil and mysterious creature. The glyphs which
  protected them have been taken, and put into huge columns the Guardian built in
  Britannia, with their entrances hidden deep in dangerous dungeons. As a result,
  the people of Britannia have lost their virtues. The Avatar must now cleanse the
  shrines and let the virtues return to the people. His task becomes particularly
  difficult because he cannot trust the people he encounters any more. With the
  help of a few allies, the Avatar will have to help the inhabitants of Britannia,
  and learn about the true origin of the Guardian.
  .
  Ultima IX: Ascension is the last single-player installment of the Ultima series,
  and the conclusion of its overarching story. The game still contains
  role-playing elements such as the series' traditional character creation based
  on ethically ambiguous questions, a quest-based structure (including side
  quests), a large world to explore, heavy inventory management, financial system,
  as well as weapon and armor customization. However, the game has no experience
  points system; the protagonist's basic attributes are increased only after
  completing certain storyline events.
  .
  Similarly to the previous installment, the combat in the game is
  action-oriented, and the protagonist has no companions that would help him in
  battles. The Avatar can use melee and ranged weapons (bows) or magic spells to
  dispose of his foes. The puzzle-oriented structure of the dungeons further
  emphasizes the game's tendency towards action-adventure gameplay not dissimilar
  to Zelda games.
  .
  The game features support for EAX sound and a fully 3D world with an almost
  unrestricted freedom of movement: in addition to climbing and jumping, which the
  Avatar has "learned" in the previous game, he can also swim and dive; some
  well-hidden locations can only be accessed in this way. The physical
  interactivity with the game world has been preserved; almost every object can be
  moved from place to place or taken into the Avatar's inventory.

  the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed
  Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical
  principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty,
  Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the
  ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full
  understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader
  and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to
  obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of
  Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.

  Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds takes place one year after the events
  of Ultima VII: The Black Gate. To celebrate the defeat of the Guardian, Lord
  British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle. However, in the
  night of the feast the Guardian attacks again, encasing the castle in a giant
  gem of blackrock. Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is
  found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to
  other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must travel to these
  worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.
  .
  This sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its
  3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice
  conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender,
  class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social
  abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased
  during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a
  sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit points
  and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an interactive
  world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved.
  .
  The game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of
  its predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the
  usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, an
  alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and sound
  have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been increased,
  there are new monster graphics and the game now features digitized sound
  effects.

  Some years after the Strider Wars, humanity has resumed its expansion into
  space. On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to
  maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal
  John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the Atlantis, patrol this dangerous sector
  of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts
  with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several
  alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with
  the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.
  .
  The first-person shooter Unreal II, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct
  connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the
  Skaarj from Unreal and the Liandri Corporation from Unreal Tournament being
  major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions,
  taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a
  research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living
  organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge
  starship.
  .
  The weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include
  pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a
  flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade
  launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including
  fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons
  adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological
  weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous
  floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the
  player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two
  different firing modes.
  .
  Missions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several
  levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a
  certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include
  additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be
  placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will
  be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders
  on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.
  .
  The story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine
  cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not
  unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments.
  Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the Atlantis and chat with his
  crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the
  main plot.

description:
  The prison transport ship Vortex Rikers was on its way to a penal moon colony
  when an unplanned course change led to it being caught in the gravity well of an
  uncharted planet. Not many aboard survive the crash landing, and those that do
  find this new world to be one full of strange beauty, but also many dangers. Not
  only is it full of dangerous wildlife, but it is the setting of a conflict
  between the ruthless Skaarj and the peaceful natives they have enslaved, the
  Nali. As one of the surviving prisoners, the player must escape the wreckage of
  the Rikers, navigate through Nali villages and temples, Skaarj mines and
  refineries, other crashed ships and many more locations, with the ultimate goal
  of finding a way off the planet.

  Unreal is a first-person shooter. Its story is mostly told through short text
  messages, deciphered via a translator from computer stations, personal logs,
  books and signs. The game features a weapon arsenal of ten guns, each with two
  firing modes. Besides standard pistols, rocket/grenade launchers, miniguns and
  sniper rifles, there are such items as the Bio Rifle, which fires blobs of toxic
  waste which stick to walls and enemies, the Flak Cannon, which sprays deadly
  shrapnel, and the Razorjack, which shoots spinning blades that ricochet off
  walls. The secondary firing mode might allow a charged shot, sacrifice accuracy
  for speed, or even make it possible to guide the projectile.
  .
  The game also includes a multiplayer mode. Ten deathmatch maps are available for
  free-for-all, team deathmatch or a variant called "King of the Hill". A special
  mode is DarkMatch, for which one special map is available. In DarkMatch, the map
  is without any illumination, and players must use a searchlight to see anything.
  The deathmatch modes can be played against bots, and the game also offers a
  cooperative version of the single player campaign.
  .
  Unreal introduced the game engine of the same name, which employs such tricks as
  colored lighting, curved surfaces, reflective surfaces, "detail" textures (via
  multi-texturing), and real time interactive mixed digital music.
  .
  Gold version includes the original Unreal game and its expansion - Return to Na
  Pali.

genre: Shooter
description:
  Unreal Tournament is the original King of the Hill in the frag-or-be-fragged
  multiplayer gaming world. As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal
  Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its
  pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal
  edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave
  gamers more than they ever expected.
  .
  Novice Mode - This Botmatch competition is where new flak fodder hit boot camp.
  The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower
  and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person
  shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born and addiction begins...
  .
  Hardcore Mode - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse
  pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the
  bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage
  with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts.
  .
  Enhanced Bot AI - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a
  big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually
  perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability
  to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real.
  .
  Radio Chatter - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied
  by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for
  cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs.
  Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents'
  messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too).
  .
  New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream
  way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak
  can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy!
  .
  Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what
  is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each
  game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game
  provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player
  with excessive info.
  .
  UBrowser - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way
  to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the
  need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as
  one-two-frag. By clicking on the "Play Online" button and then selecting a
  server from the list, the game is on.
  .
  Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be
  almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter
  a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the
  level. Even cooler, the camera can be "attached" to one of the players in the
  level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature
  and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming.
  .
  Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending
  pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost
  indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.

  What is Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York?
  .
  Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York aims to translate the complex and
  fascinating world of vampires, their nightly struggles for power and attempts to
  hold on to their humanity.
  .
  How do you play Coteries of New York
  .
  You act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York. You have to learn what it means
  to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your
  way you'll meet different NPCs - other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans...
  and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part
  in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the
  Anarchs. You'll interact with key NPCs - form unique bonds and relations and
  learn your undead companions' deepest secrets... or see them abandon you. You'll
  feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity. You
  will have to keep track of your Hunger or the Beast inside you will take over.
  You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue
  and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a
  narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all
  among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You will be able to use Disciplines that
  will help you in combat and conversations, but be aware that every use of a
  Discipline may increase the level of your Hunger. Left unchecked, your Hunger
  will force you to give control over to the Beast: a dark side of your nature
  which wishes only to feed... no matter the cost.
  .
  If it's called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in
  common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, the cult tabletop RPG system,
  or...?
  .
  Yes, exactly! Coteries of New York is set in the same universe as Bloodlines 2,
  but our game offers different experiences and stories.
  .
  Do you plan to expand the universe of Coteries of New York
  .
  As for post-launch support, we'll keep you updated. We would love to expand
  Coteries' stories, but it depends on many factors and we do not want to over
  promise anything.
  .
  Which platforms will Coteries of New York be available on?
  .
  Coteries of New York is available on PC (Windows, Mac OS and Linux). The game
  will launch on PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in Q1 2020.
  .
  Does the game support controllers?
  .
  Yes! You're able to play the PC version both with mouse and keyboard, as well as
  with a controller.

  It is the Middle Ages in Europe, and people live in constant fear of demons and
  God's punishment. Christof is a warrior who fights the creatures of darkness.
  After being badly injured in a battle, he is nursed back to health by the nun
  Anezka in a Prague convent. Love strikes Christof when he least expects it. He
  realizes that it is impossible for him and Anezka to be together, but he swears
  to protect her and the town of Prague from demons. What he does not know is that
  Prague has become a battlefield for the struggle between different vampire
  clans. The Brujah clan sees a duty in protecting their wisdom and the
  unsuspecting mortals from the more vicious clans. They turn Christof into a
  vampire, hoping to use his skills and his passion for their cause.
  .
  Christof has lost his soul, his faith, everything he had ever had, becoming one
  of those he had always fought and hated. But his love to Anezka has not died.
  And so Christof agrees to help the Brujah, getting involved in a complex net of
  intrigues and struggle between vampire clans, a struggle that will eventually
  take him to modern times, to London and New York, where his fate will finally be
  decided.
  .
  Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing
  game Vampire: The Masquerade. Much of the game is dedicated to exploring hostile
  locations, fighting enemies (mostly other vampires) to complete missions and
  advance the storyline. Gaining experience points, the player develops Christof
  and other characters by increasing their statistics (such as Strength,
  Intelligence, Manipulation etc.) or learning and improving various disciplines,
  the magic spells of the game. Disciplines require blood, which can be restored
  with items or by feeding on enemies.
  .
  Combat is action-oriented. The player can directly control only one member of
  the party ("coterie"); the rest are controlled by AI. It is possible to switch
  between different characters at any time. Following the ethical code of the RPG,
  there is a Humanity bar for Christof, which can be reduces if the player decides
  to kill innocents or make evil decisions in the game. The game has several
  different endings that depend on the protagonist's Humanity level. There is also
  a multiplayer option.

description:
  You're a nobody. An outcast in your own vampiric sect. A political prisoner of
  no particular value. An immigrant who never found her roots in a city of
  immigrants. A chainsmoker whose favorite pastime is staring blankly at the
  streets through the windows of a fast food joint at 4AM. The sinking feeling in
  the pit of your stomach tells you that you're doomed, and distorted voices from
  the shadows seem to agree. The curse of your clan makes interacting with
  everyday technology difficult. Dissociation is your natural state.
  .
  But when New York's Anarch leader meets a gruesome end, out of all the
  bloodsuckers in the metropolis, you're the one picked to investigate. Make no
  mistake: this is obviously a trap, yet another move in the horrible game of
  Jyhad, the eternal struggle for power between warring vampire generations. But
  you're Lasombra, and if there's one thing you know, it's this: if the Ventrue
  Prince and her followers underestimate you, they're going to deeply regret it.

  original soundtrack.
  .
  Play as a member of the Lasombra clan. Formerly vicious foes of the Camarilla,
  the Magisters decided to search for safety in the ranks of their former enemies.
  Master the shadows and communicate with the inhabitants of the Other Side, but
  beware - Oblivion is always lurking out there, ready to devour you whole.
  .
  Explore the streets of the Big Apple. While you search for ways to satiate your
  bloodthirst, catch glimpses of various fascinating vignettes and forge
  connections with the eccentric inhabitants of the city. One playthrough won't be
  enough to see it all.
  .
  Shape your mind, shape your fate. You used to avoid defining yourself and tried
  to stay neutral, but given your situation, you can no longer afford to do so.
  The choices you make will alter the way you think, and your thinking will alter
  the paths you take.
  .
  If it's called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in
  common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, Redemption, the cult tabletop RPG
  system, or...?
  .
  Yes. Shadows of New York is set in the same shared universe, but offers
  independent experiences and stories. You may spot some connections with the
  other titles, but Shadows is not a sequel to any existing products. The World of
  Darkness is a media franchise and shared universe, shaped by various creators
  and participants, meaning: all stand-alone stories play into a greater whole.
  Berlin falling to the Anarchs during an official LARP, the Lasombra clan joining
  forces with the Camarilla in the Vampire: The Masquerade - Chicago By Night 5th
  Edition sourcebook, Sophie Langley's plot to take control of New York in
  Coteries of New York - all of these events subtly influence and interact with
  each other.
  .
  Do I need to play Coteries of New York to understand and enjoy the story of
  Shadows of New York?
  .
  Not at all. Shadows of New York is a continuation of Coteries of New York, which
  means it shares the New York City setting and a large part of the supporting
  cast with our previous title, but is designed to offer a different experience.
  Coteries served as an introduction to the basics of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th
  Edition - it was focused on showcasing different vampire Clans and core concepts
  of the setting through the point of view of a newly-fledged vampire, a character
  who did have a defined backstory, but by and large meant to serve as a player
  avatar.
  .
  Shadows of New York is a more personal story, told from the perspective of a
  well-defined character who's already integrated into the Kindred society and has
  a developed inner monologue of her own (which means you influence her
  personality instead of shaping it). Those who are familiar with Coteries will
  already know a large part of the cast and catch some references that would
  otherwise go unnoticed, but those who decide to start with Shadows and get back
  to Coteries later should be able to enjoy both experiences just as much as they
  would if they played them in their release order. The two stories are
  essentially separate, different both tonally and thematically.
  .
  Which platforms is Shadows of New York available on?
  .
  Shadows of New York launched simultaneously on PC (Windows/Mac OS/Linux), PS4,
  Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in September 2020.
  .
  Does the game support controllers?
  .
  Yes. You're able to play both with mouse and keyboard, as well as with a
  controller.

developer: The Astronauts
publisher: The Astronauts
genre: Adventure
description:
  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that
  focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or
  explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won't be able
  to see them.
  .
  You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a
  disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul
  arrives at Ethan's home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even
  worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which
  Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.
  .
  Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early
  twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve
  immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite
  a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially
  puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity
  of our characters.
  .
  Still, the discoveries won't happen on their own, or without your help. Using
  both Paul's supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and
  your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of
  corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the
  fate of a missing boy.

genre: Action;Construction and Management Simulation;Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  War for the Overworld is a spiritual successor to Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper
  series from the nineties. The concept is largely similar as it is a blend of
  real-time strategy, god game, first-person action and role-playing in a fantasy
  setting. You are an Underlord, an evil etheral lord of the Underworld. After a
  long exile in the void you wake up in a world where the Empire (the 'Good Guys')
  is ruling, while the Underlords are fighting each other in the Underworld.
  .
  You have to restore your realm and your powers and build new dungeons for your
  minions, while resisting the Empire's forces. As an ethereal power, you cannot
  physically act in the real world. Your ethereal hand can trace zones to dig or
  to build rooms, cast spells, or seize units to drag them in a specific room. You
  need gold to build rooms or to pay your creatures and if you do not produce
  food, they will starve and revolt.
  .
  Each room attracts a different type of creature and allows for further
  development of the dungeon. Barracks train creatures, a library allows for
  research with new rooms, spells, traps ..., a foundry lets you build defences
  and so on.
  .
  The game contains a solo campaign of ten scenarios, two solo sandbox maps, three
  solo scenario maps and 36 solo/multiplayer skirmish maps. Multiplayer is
  supported both through local LAN and online.

developer: InXile Entertainment

genre: Role-Playing;Western-Style
description:
  Wasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer
  RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games,
  and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations,
  to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences
  of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-
  lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it
  one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the
  Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the
  Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition.
  .
  Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American
  Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions,
  acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that
  changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a
  strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline
  that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation
  and insights, will recapture all that and provide more. It'll finally be the
  game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the
  original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.

description:
  Wasteland 2 is the sequel to the 1988 title Wasteland. The game lets the player
  take control of a squad of rangers, in an attempt to explore the surrounding
  world, solve quests and defeat enemies.
  .
  Just like the original game it is a post-apocalyptic turn and party based RPG
  with tactical combat. The action takes place fifteen years after the end of the
  first Wasteland, kicking off with the player being tasked with finding out what
  happened to an experienced ranger who died in mysterious circumstances.
  Throughout the story, the player encounters enemies, quests, and different
  puzzles. The game lets players choose their own way to approach any situation
  they encounter, with skills, items and quests having an important impact on the
  surrounding world.
  .
  The party can consist of seven characters, up to four designed by the player
  with specific statistics, skills, opinions and traits, and three or more NPCs.
  The game puts a large emphasis on choice and consequence permanently affecting
  the characters and the game world.
  .
  Wasteland 2: Director's Cut is an enhanced version of Wasteland 2. For Xbox One
  and PS4 it is the first version of the game. For PC it is provided as a digital
  download for free to owners of the original version and it can also be bought
  separately. For GOG and Steam it does not replace the default version and it is
  available separately. Save files cannot be transferred.
  .
  The graphics have been overhauled and the game engine has been updated to Unity
  5. Improvements affect character models and environment art. There are also new
  visual effects for fire and explosions. Through Unity 5's physically-based
  rendering system, there are more realistic lighting conditions. The voice-overs
  are expanded with new voices. For the game mechanics a precision strike system
  is added to target individual body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) with negative
  status effects, similar to V.A.T.S. in Fallout games. There is a new perk system
  where a perk point is provided for every four character levels. The available
  perks depend on the character's skills. During character generation a quirk can
  be chosen, a specific personality trait that is permanent. There is rebalanced
  gameplay for weapon statistics, container locations, content scenes, merchant
  inventories, loot drops and more.
  .
  Changes during combat for enemy placement, numbers and cover positions have been
  implemented as well. There are new weapons in the game, found in hidden
  containers or carried by NPCs. The armour system is updated to make heavy armour
  conductive. This mainly affects the use of energy weapons as they do bonus
  damage against conductive armour and less damage against normal targets, instead
  of scaling the armour value. Along with the console release there is controller
  support for the PC versions.

developer: Sir-tech Software, Inc.
publisher: Sir-tech Software, Inc.
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Wizardry 8 is the eighth and final title in the Wizardry series of role-playing
  video games by Sir-Tech Canada. It is the third in the Dark Savant trilogy,
  which includes Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge and Wizardry VII: Crusaders
  of the Dark Savant. It was published in 2001 by Sir-Tech, and re-released by
  Night Dive Studios on GOG.com and Steam in 2013.
  .
  Wizardry 8 is a direct sequel to Crusaders of the Dark Savant, the previous
  installment of the Wizardry series. All hell breaks loose as The Dark Savant
  takes flight with a device called the Astral Dominae, an incredibly powerful
  artifact containing the secret of life itself. Following him are two powerful
  races, the T'Rang and the Umpani, as well as the player's own brave party of
  adventurers. Everyone is heading to Dominus, a world on the cusp of the Cosmic
  Circle, birthplace of the Astral Dominae and home of the Cosmic Lords. Many
  paths will converge on Dominus, and many long-hidden secrets will be revealed.
  .
  The basic gameplay system is similar to the previous entries in the series: the
  player-controlled party of up to six characters roams the world viewed from a
  first-person perspective, completes quests and fights enemies to gain experience
  and become stronger. Unlike those, however, Wizardry 8 has a real 3D
  environment, where enemies visibly approach the party (rather than appearing
  randomly). The party is also able to move during combat, sometimes using terrain
  to its advantage. Character formation plays a role, the player being able to use
  tactical setups for the party in order to be better prepared for upcoming
  fights. Though still turn-based, the battles are more flowing than in the
  earlier games, since the characters act depending on their personal statistics
  rather than being confined by rounds.
  .
  The eleven races from the two previous games return, encompassing traditional
  fantasy RPG representatives such as elves and dwarves, as well as the more
  exotic rawulfs, felpurrs and mooks. A new character class, the Gadgeteer, has
  been added to the other fourteen imported from the previous games. The player
  can customize the statistics of these characters as he sees fit during the party
  creation phase. It is also possible to add personality traits to each of the
  characters. These do not affect the gameplay, but provide commentaries from the
  party members during conversations with the NPCs. A skill system is used for all
  the character types, ranging from weapon and magical proficiencies to
  pickpocketing and communication. Skills, as well as main attributes, can be
  manually developed by the player when the character levels up, but they also
  increase with repeated use.
  .
  Similarly to its predecessor, Wizardry 8 has several beginnings depending
  whether the player has imported a party from Crusaders of the Dark Savant or
  not, and which faction that party was allied with in the previous game. The game
  also has three different endings, which are achieved by making choices before
  the final confrontation.

description:
  Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is an action-adventure first-person shooter video
  game developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was
  released on May 5, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The
  game is a stand-alone expansion pack in the Wolfenstein series, and a prequel to
  2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order. Set in an alternate history 1946, the single-
  player story follows war veteran William "B.J." Blazkowicz and his efforts to
  discover the locations of a Nazi compound. Development began in 2014, soon after
  the release of The New Order.
  .
  The game is played from a first-person perspective and its levels are navigated
  on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to
  progress through the story. It is separated into two interconnected campaigns.
  The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, and
  explosives, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present;
  players lean in and out of cover instead of the more common system where players
  lock into cover.
  .
  Wolfenstein: The Old Blood was met with a generally positive reception upon
  release. Many critics praised the game's intense firefights, intriguing
  locations, and the balance between stealth and action. Many critics disliked the
  game's story however, with most reviewers saying it was the weakest part of the
  game, and that it is a step back compared to The New Order's story, which was
  heavily complimented.

  Prepare yourself for the most thrilling night of your life! Something strange
  has happened and people everywhere are turning into blood thirsty walking
  corpses. But guess who's the brains behind this hungry undead army? YOU! So
  spread this pandemic to wipe humanity off this planet. Because the only way to
  survive the zombie apocalypse, is to BE the apocalypse!
  .
  But the brainless undead are quite dumb... even dumber than you might expect given
  their lack of grey matter. Because when left to their own devises, they will
  just endlessly walk forward and fall into permanently deadly booby traps placed
  by not-so-helpless humans. So to accomplish your mission of world extermination,
  you will need to help guide them to their next yummy meal. Luckily you can
  utilize numerous special mutations to make your troops evolve and fulfil their
  appetite for flesh. But beware! Humans will not facilitate your dark will....they
  will fight to survive.
  .
  Spread terror through 50 levels and enrol more zombies into your undead army.
  Along the way you'll have to solve brain tingling puzzles, and fight
  increasingly powerful foes that are hell-bent on staying alive. The closer you
  get to total world extinction, the harder survivors will fight to put you in the
  ground....for good.
  .
  Blood, tears, non-sexual moans, inappropriate laughter, and tons of puzzles that
  will literally blow your brains out... This is Zombie Night Terror!
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  - Command a Zombie Horde: You are the brain, they are the muscles. Your zombie
  horde will obey your commands without any strike risk or complaints ... On the
  downside; you can't have any heated conversations about late night movies or
  cool books anymore tough!\n
  - Unique Mutation System: Having an army of deadly zombies is awesome. Having an
  army of mutated zombies is way better! Take advantage of our mutation system to
  overcome the enemy's defences, by creating powerful new zombie types. Each has
  their unique power and abilities that can help you overcome different
  situations.\n
  - Combo System: Because you thought mutations were your only way to facilitate
  your meat feast, we spiced it up allowing you to combine those and see what your
  enemies are made of (literally). Let's show those pesky humans how to have
  fun!\n
  - Level Editor With Full Steam Workshop Support: Ever wanted to create your very
  own devious Zombie Apocalypse? Then we do have something for you! The Level
  Editor lets you design levels from scratch and share them with the community,
  using Steam Workshop. Start slow by crafting a single level, then crank things
  up with a full chapter loaded with enemies, traps, bonuses, mutations, and
  intellectually superior dialogue of your own choosing, all of which unfolds
  according to your devious plan.\n
  - You are not alone: Having zombies is kind of like having a pet; it's fun but
  you need to take care of them... That's what humans are for, as they are the
  perfect way to keep your zombies well fed and busy. But beware! Humans are well
  armed and they do not appreciate the toothy company of the undead.\n
  - Contaminate: Don't have enough company? Do you need a bigger horde? Well, just
  convert Humans to your cause then! You don't necessary need to bring flowers and
  be charming, as a single bite right into the neck (or anywhere that pleases you)
  should be enough to do the trick!\n
  - Destructible Environments: In times of a zombie apocalypse, humans love to
  take their time playing hide and seek. However when the hunger for tasty flesh
  is this painful, you don't have time for such childishness. So use the power or
  your horde to destroy their playground and spread terror among them... PEEKABOOM!

  Zoria: Age of Shattering is coming soon! You can wishlist it here
  .
  Zoria: Age of Shattering is a classic tactical RPG with fluid turn-based combat,
  outpost, and followers management.
  .
  You will lead a diverse team through the various lands of a Uram continent and
  against challenges countless groups of monsters and bosses.
  .
  Zoria has now fallen prey to the sheer brutality of the hellspawn that roams its
  land. Its lush forests, mysterious caves, and majestic buildings have
  transformed into haunting and dreadful locations. Take your time and explore
  unknown areas, as each holds a mystery.
  .
  Combat is bread and butter, and you will engage in it easily. Use the unique
  skills of all of your party members:
  .
  Attack from close range or distance with different attack patterns and
  directions,
  .
  Heal or shield allies with various spells and commands,
  .
  Inflict status aliments like damage over time, stun, immobilize, and other
  elemental effects,
  .
  Use your surroundings to use to your advantage or create new ones to separate
  you from the enemies
  .
  Keep a keen eye on your equipment and vitality as they both deteriorate over
  time. A bonfire in Zoria's provides a safe spot to restock your resources and
  prepare for the next battle.
  .
  Take care of each of your warriors' skill development, and it will repay you on
  the battlefield. Remember that having an individual with the right skills can
  get you into previously inaccessible places and quests. It may turn out that
  interacting with a specific character with various objects in the world of Zoria
  may lead you to discover hidden treasures or make your travel easier.
  .
  You have to be wise in and out of the battle. You cannot win the game without
  making progress - this also counts toward your outpost. You may regularly update
  the base by unlocking new wings to the buildings, and by doing so, you will be
  rewarded with either resources, quests, or items. Different buildings will have
  different numbers of available upgrades.
  .
  In your outpost, you can plan and assign tasks to your companions. Send selected
  party members on an autonomic mission, in which you won't participate but will
  receive what they find along the way. You will also get some of the experience
  they gain. Never forget that their lives are in your hands!
