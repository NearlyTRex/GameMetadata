  Stormhill Mystery: Family Shadows is a fantastic casual puzzle adventure game.
  This is an excellent family story with a paranormal twist!
  .
  One of my father's stories was my favorite: "Once upon a time there lived a
  merchant with his wife. The family was happy and had never known grief. However,
  their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly
  dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers
  hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual... although
  there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The
  merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his
  beloved wife from her cursed world."
  .
  Years have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: "Your favorite
  fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's
  spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is
  waiting in our old family home." As a son, I must "write" the happy ending for
  my family's story.
