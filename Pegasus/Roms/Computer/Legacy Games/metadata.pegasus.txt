  dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers

  there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The
  merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his
  beloved wife from her cursed world."

  Years have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: "Your favorite
  fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's
  spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is
  waiting in our old family home." As a son, I must "write" the happy ending for
  my family's story.
