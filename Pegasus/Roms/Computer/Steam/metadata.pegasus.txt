genre: Action;Platformer;2D
description:
  After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of
  nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under
  the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild
  the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of
  the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong
  hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been
  seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of
  the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands,
  and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!
  The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest
  and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you
  must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes'
  soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant
  wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to
  retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the
  8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he
  may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of
  all mankind!

description:
  Aperture Desk Job reimagines the been-there-done-that genre of walking
  simulators and puts them in the lightning-spanked, endorphin-gorged world of
  sitting still behind things.
  .
  You play as an entry-level nobody on their first day at work - your heart full
  of hope and your legs full of dreams, eager to climb that corporate ladder. But
  life's got other plans, and they all involve chairs.
  .
  Designed as a free playable short for Valve's new Steam Deck, Desk Job walks you
  through the handheld's controls and features, while not being nearly as boring
  as that sounds.
  .
  Not Portal 3!
  .
  Lower your expectations: This is not a sequel to Portal. Now get ready to raise
  them slightly, because it is in the expanded universe of those games. Desk Job
  puts you squarely in the driver's seat at Aperture Science. Then quickly removes
  the driving part and adds a desk in front of the seat.
  .
  Steam Deck: A Desk For Your Hands
  .
  Up until now, real life mostly involved sitting, and video games were the
  virtual fantasy world you could escape to. With the portable Steam Deck, we
  flipped that, freeing your body to run marathons and jump out of planes while
  your brain and hands simulate all the sitting you used to do.
  .
  It's F-R-E-E (Free)!
  .
  Put that wallet away, gaming fan! Your money's no good here. For this particular
  product. If your money stops working while trying to buy groceries, though, you
  should contact your bank immediately, because the cashier just stole your entire
  identity? You'd better go talk to her again, because what do you mean she never
  worked here?! Now you'll have to go undercover as a dark web hacker to track her
  down! Only to find out it was a different timeline you?!! From the future?!?!
  And also if anyone from Hollywood is reading this bullet point, take your wallet
  back out, because this great idea is not free (but is for sale at

  AppGameKit Classic is a powerful game development engine, ideal for Beginners,
  Hobbyists & Indie developers. Now anyone can quickly code and build apps for
  multiple platforms using AppGameKit's BASIC scripting system. With just a few
  commands you can have demos/games up and running on mobile devices. Bob Duffy,
  Developer Relations Intel Corporation, said "AppGameKit is a great cross
  platform development tool. It allows developers to quickly optimize and compile
  apps."
  .
  Games can be developed and deployed to your chosen mobile devices for rapid
  prototyping. AppGameKit Classic does all the heavy lifting for you - making it
  easy to code, compile and then export apps to each platform. All you need to
  focus on is your game/app idea. It's that simple!

  Axis Game Factory's AGFPRO v3.0 - for PC, MAC and LINUX
  .
  We just released version 3.0 of AGFPRO & Premium - there are a TON of new
  features, assets and functionality that have been added, giving users the
  ability to create amazing game levels and maps like NEVER BEFORE!!
  .
  Major features to AGFPRO 3.0 include compatibility with Unity 5 for AGFPRO,
  Premium, Zombie FPS, Fantasy Side-Scroller, Drone Kombat, BattleMat Multiplayer,
  and Voxel Sculpt! We have also added new character controls and characters in
  both the ARPG and Platformer Players! What you will really see is the POWER and
  SPEED that comes with this update, allowing users to create lush scenes, filled
  with assets, foliage and other features and functionality.
  .
  AGFPRO v3.0 is a comprehensive toolset designed to provide game developers and
  enthusiasts with a powerful and rapid level creation, terrain/vegetation
  editing, lighting and atmosphere system.
  .
  AGF is an independent product that empowers users to create game levels and
  environments for many types of game genres, and the AGFPRO v3.0 PREMIUM version
  is also designed to work in concert with the Free and Pro versions of the Unity
  5 game engine to allow further customization and game publishing. AGF runs on
  the PC, MAC and LINUX systems.
  .
  AGF allows developers to rapidly create game maps, sculpt terrain and design
  levels quickly and easily. With over 1000+ assets pre-stocked in the warehouse,
  along with 48 pre-set themes and 8 sample maps, developers and enthusiasts can
  begin creating levels in minutes. AGFPRO v3.0 includes all of the necessary
  tools to allow users the ability to import AGF scenes into Unity3d Free and Pro
  5.
  .
  Please note that due to Unity's change in business model from free and paid
  versions to a subscription model, we have been unable to maintain updates to
  align with our development pipeline and business model. AGFPRO works as a
  standalone product for hobbyists as well as for developers who work from Unity 5
  through January 2018. Be advised that if you plan to use AGFPRO for professional
  game development, there may be certain features in recent Unity updates that do
  not work.
  .
  Creating game levels and maps in AGFPRO is easy and fun - now ANYONE can create
  their own quality game maps without having to program, model or animate!
  .
  In order to use AGFPRO Premium (DLC), you must first purchase AGFPRO.

  share with others

  game level creations with friends and link their maps together for endless
  gameplay!
  .
  FPS Weapon asset packs are also included

  More Information on what AGFPRO is and what you can do with AGFPRO
  .
  Users are able to create game levels and maps using the software and also place
  characters (provided with the software) to play and explore their levels with
  multiple player style options (Action Role Playing, Platformer, FPS)
  .
  Just to be CLEAR - AGFPRO is NOT a game engine. It is literally made using the
  Unity game engine. AGFPRO is a real-time, RAPID Game Environment Development
  Toolkit and is made to be used in concert with Unity Free and Pro for level/map
  creation. - However, AGFPRO does NOT need Unity to run or create levels/maps.
  .
  The scene files that users create in AGFPRO "Basic" and "Premium" can be
  imported into Unity5 Free and Pro using our AGF/Unity tools.
  .
  By using the DLC we have already released for AGFPRO (Fantasy Side-Scroller,
  Zombie FPS, Drone Kombat, BattleMat Multiplayer & Voxel Sculp), users are able
  to create playable levels with AGFPRO (only - not viable with Unity) with a
  variety of characters, assets, gameplay mechanics and special feature, "Scene-
  Linking" to connect game levels
  .
  There are limitations to some asset packs "locked (L)" that limit the users from
  loading these assets into Unity. All unlocked asset packs are free of copyright
  and can be used via Unity for redistribution per the terms of the EULA
  .
  The redistribution or "sharing" of the games users are able to make using AGF
  and DLC "Players" is a feature we are working on at this time and will be made
  available to users at no additional fee
  .
  Users are also able to create and place specific game play mechanics that are
  provided in the software
  .
  Full customization of your levels and maps is possible with AGFPRO Premium and
  Unity Pro, whereby users are able to bring in their own assets and models to
  make their games unique and further commercialize, making a complete Stand-Alone
  game
  .
  Additional Questions RE: AGFPRO?
  .
  If you are interested in making a complete Stand-Alone game with unique
  characters, models, assets and game play mechanics not provided in AGFPRO and
  commercialize it for sale, you will need AGFPRO Premium and either Unity Free or
  Pro software
  .
  If you are a development team using AGFPRO + Premium, you will need one seat per
  team member using the software, but we do offer studio discounts, so be sure to
  contact us for special pricing
  .
  We have many schools all over the globe using AGFPRO to teach game development
  and design in the classroom, from middle schools to elite Colleges and
  Universities. We have a basic curriculum available that instructors are able to
  include in their course curriculum and we provide additional support that
  includes software updates, access to DLC, non-Steam versions of the software if
  necessary, user support and special feature integration upon request and based
  on the terms of the agreement. We offer special pricing for schools and we find
  that schools love using the software as it allows students the ability to create
  complete games within the limitation of a semester and is a great introduction
  to begin to interface with Unity3d, without users having to program, model,
  animate or script.

  faces of your enemies, command savage armies, bang skulls in hand-to-hand
  combat, and rise like a bat out of hell to command blood-drenched action from
  above. As if that wasn't enough, you can slay your friends and foes online, then

  Game List:
  .
  .
  Castlevania (1987/US, 1988/EU) NES
  .
  You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves,
  bats creatures lurking around every corner. Better pick up a weapon or two,
  because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the
  jugular.
  .
  .
  Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (1988/US, 1990/EU) NES
  .
  This title tells the tale of Simon's subsequent adventures following the events
  in Castlevania. Unlike the previous installment, this one was developed as an
  action RPG. It maintains the action elements of its predecessor but mainly
  focuses on exploration and puzzle solving within a far more expansive game
  world.
  .
  .
  Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse (1990/US, 1992/EU) NES
  .
  Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is
  poised to bury mankind in a tomb of terror. Destroying His legions will be the
  supreme challenge for the mightiest warrior.
  .
  100 years before Simon Belmont's birth, Dracula is young at heart and it will
  take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of
  Trevor - Simon's forefather and the original vampire slayer.
  .
  .
  Super Castlevania IV (1991/US, 1992/EU) SNES
  .
  A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once
  again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they
  shrink from new horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And
  this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.
  .
  .
  Castlevania: The Adventure (1989/US, 1991/EU) GB
  .
  This is the first title in the series to be released on the Game Boy handheld
  game console. The variety of power-ups available for the whip added depth to the
  strategy of the gameplay.
  .
  .
  Castlevania: Belmont's Revenge (1991/US, 1992/EU) GB
  .
  Fifteen years after vanquishing the evil Count Dracula, Christopher Belmont now
  faces a vampire swearing vengeance. Drac's back. And he's turned your son,
  Soleil Belmont, into a deadly demon to do his dirty deeds. To rescue him from
  the Count's clutches, you must first track him down through four creep packed
  castles.
  .
  .
  Castlevania Bloodlines (1994) GEN
  .
  Unlike the medieval setting of the other titles, this installment takes place
  during World War I. It introduces new elements to the series, such as the
  ability to choose one of two characters when starting the game. Huge bosses with
  dynamic, multi-jointed limbs that move erratically are just one of the many
  examples of the cutting-edge effects the game had for the time.
  .
  .
  Kid Dracula (1990/Japan exclusive) NES
  .
  With its laugh-inducing content and world full of gags, this spinoff is unlike
  anything else in the series. Players take control of Dracula's son (or so he
  says...), Kid Dracula, as he goes on a hilarious adventure filled with laughs
  that also satisfies as a full-fledged action game.

  In The Cat and the Coup, you play the cat of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, the first
  democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran. During the summer of 1953, the
  CIA engineered a coup to bring about his downfall. As a player, you coax
  Mossadegh back through significant events of his life by knocking objects off
  shelves, scattering his papers, and scratching him.
  .
  The game, situated within the traditions of Persian miniature art form and cold
  war foreign policy, asks players to consider their connection to Iranian
  history. The Cat and the Coup is both about the relationship between the Western
  video game player and Mossadegh and, by extension, the United States and Iran.

  pry from the environment around you. You'll need to make sure nothing stops you

  Morgan Shane has disappeared, leaving a bloody trail of mayhem in her wake.
  But is she a monster or a victim of something far more sinister than the

  the mystery before the same dark force that targeted Morgan finds you?

  friend of Morgan's who is on a mission to find and save her -- and uncover
  the truth of what happened to her. Desperate for help, he is asking for your
  help. Your only tool is a backup of his hard drive. And that's where your
  journey begins -- sifting through the material he's unearthed in his quest
  for the truth. But the real challenge is to keep from falling victim to the
  same dark forces that claimed his friends, and by "getting involved" you may
  have made yourself vulnerable.
  .
  The trail will eventually lead you out onto the web and into a different kind
  of web -- one woven with international conspiracy and supernatural forces.
  You will need wits, patience, and nerve to unravel the mystery, save Morgan,
  and save yourself.

  VERSATILE VR SOLUTION
  .
  Unlock the hidden potential of virtual reality with Driver4VR! It will help you
  in enhancing your experience with many useful features, including:
  .
  Body tracking
  .
  Head & hand tracking
  .
  Controller emulation
  .
  tVR (virtual reality on monitor or TV)
  .
  Utilities
  .
  WHAT MAKES DRIVER4VR STAND OUT?
  .
  Simple & powerful VR features
  .
  Years of experience & ongoing development
  .
  Lots of usage options (body tracking, controller emulation & more)
  .
  Global Discord community
  .
  Easy setup & helpful tutorials
  .
  Affordable price for a convenient VR tool
  .
  Driver4VR is also the main source of funding for WalkinVR, the first software
  that allows people with disabilities to play VR games.
  .
  MANY WAYS OF BODY TRACKING
  .
  This VR solution allows adding body tracking for existing VR setups like Oculus,
  HTC Vive or Valve Index. It can emulate body tracking with:
  .
  Puppeteer - actually emulation with hand controllers :)
  .
  Kinect
  .
  Web Camera
  .
  Oculus CV1 Touch Controllers
  .
  Nolo VR
  .
  PS Controllers with PS Eye cameras via PSMoveServiceEx
  .
  Camera Markers with PS Eye Camera
  .
  VR ON MONITOR OR TV
  .
  Driver4VR allows users to play some VR games on TV (this solution is called
  tVR). It's an alternative way to use VR content for people who for some reason
  can't do it in a classic way (with headset and controllers).
  .
  3DOF and 6DOF TRACKING POSSIBILITIES
  .
  For 3DoF Headsets like phone-vr, PSVR or VRTek, Driver4VR can add position
  tracking and controller emulation. It also uses alternative devices (previous
  generation consoles, mice, keyboard) to emulate virtual reality controllers and
  input.
  .
  Additionally, it can add positional tracking (6DoF) in case you have a headset
  that just supports the rotation like phone-based VR, VR Tek, Pimax, etc. It uses
  Kinect to emulate positional tracking.
  .
  Please note that we are using alternative tracking methods to approximate a true
  6DOF experience. You may want to look into Oculus Quest or similar devices at a
  cheap price for the head and hands tracking and use Driver4VR for only the body
  tracking - feet and waist.
  .
  SMART CONTROLLER EMULATION
  .
  Controllers can be emulated with devices like PS Move, Joy-Con, Wii Remote, VR
  Gamepad, Mouse, Xbox Controller, Keyboard. Combined with positional tracking, it
  makes a complete virtual reality setup with hand tracking and input.
  .
  Without Kinect you can use those devices alone to emulate position a'la Oculus
  Go which is called Virtual Tracking.
  .
  USEFUL VR UTILITIES
  .
  Driver4VR is also a set of useful virtual reality utilities like e.g. Virtual
  Move, Input Emulation, fix floor position, emulation of broken Index thumbstick
  with touchpad and many others.
  .
  REQUIREMENTS
  .
  Bluetooth devices (Bluetooth connection required):
  .
  Nintendo Switch JoyCon
  .
  Nintendo Wii Remote
  .
  PS3 Move / PS4 Move
  .
  VR Gamepad
  .
  Web Camera:
  .
  Any PC Compatible Web Camera
  .
  Kinect:
  .
  Kinect 360 - Kinect 360 adapter and standard USB 2.0
  .
  Kinect 2.0 - Kinect 2.0 adapter and USB 3.0
  .
  IMPORTANT UPDATES & SUPPORT
  .
  PSVR Display Driver and PS4 Camera tracking goes out of support by end of June
  2024.
  .
  Wii Remote model RVL-CNT-01-TR is not yet supported at the moment but working on
  it.
  .
  When using the Driver4VR for the first time, it MUST be started from the
  "Launch" button, to ensure any additional services and drivers it requires get
  installed.
  .
  Got questions or installation issues? Ask away at for technical answers & great
  solutions to use Driver4VR. You can also join our thriving Discord community &
  share thoughts with other users.

  THE FATE OF THE CITY IS IN YOUR HANDS
  .
  .
  It's been 15 years since humanity lost to the virus.
  .
  .
  The last great human settlement exists within an unforgiving, infected world,
  plunged into a modern dark age. During the day, bandits, factions and starving
  survivors roam the streets scavenging for scraps - or someone to take them from,
  by violence if necessary. At night the infected roam free, evacuating their dark
  hideouts to prey on the living.
  .
  .
  You are Aiden Caldwell, an infected survivor. Your exceptional agility and
  brutal combat skills make you a powerful ally and a valuable commodity in this
  dangerous world. You can achieve things no one else can. Enter places no one
  else dares. With your unique abilities you have the power to be an agent of
  change within this decaying metropolis.
  .
  .
  YOUR CHOICES, YOUR WORLD
  .
  You must make tough decisions and hard sacrifices as you decide the fate of a
  society on the brink of collapse. The effect of the choices you make will have a
  huge impact on entire regions of the city, uncovering new land masses and areas
  to explore. Play the entire campaign in up to four-player co-op. Host your own
  games or join other players' and see how their choices have played out
  differently to your own.
  .
  .
  EXCEPTIONAL AGILITY AND BRUTAL COMBAT
  .
  On your journey from humble beginnings to a person of great power, you have
  unprecedented freedom of movement across the city, seamlessly integrated with
  brutal first person combat.
  .
  .
  A MODERN DARK AGE
  .
  In a desperate city, where resources and power are scarce, unstable, and trust
  in ruling bodies is all but eroded; humankind has reverted to a dark age.
  Civilization is gone but the relics are still there. This is a violent, primal &
  unforgiving world - and so are its inhabitants.
  .
  .
  THE INFECTION HAS EVOLVED
  .
  The infection has evolved and become more sensitive to UV light. Society exists
  in the relative safety of sunlight, while the infected hide in the shadows of
  buildings. At night the infected roam the streets freely searching for prey,
  presenting opportunities for you to explore areas of the city inaccessible by
  day.

  Please only purchase if you wish to help with the development process of the
  game! Thank you!
  .
  Welcome to Gone Fishing, a multiplayer co-op horror game where players must fish
  together to satisfy the hunger of an ancient lake monster's never-ending hunger
  before each night falls.
  .
  Cast your line, catch fish, and gather bait. But beneath the surface, something
  stirs and it's getting hungry... If you and your friends fail to offer enough
  fish before darkness creeps in, the creature will emerge, hunting you
  relentlessly. The cabin won't keep you safe. Running won't either. Only a full
  offering can delay the inevitable.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  Immersive Fishing System: Catch a variety of fish species, each with unique
  behaviors, fight patterns, and sizes.
  .
  Dynamic Bait Collection: Hunt for live bait, frogs, worms, spiders, and bats,
  that each react differently to your presence.
  .
  Atmospheric Horror: Peaceful days turn into tense nights as the monster grows
  more aggressive with each failed offering.
  .
  Co-Op Survival: Coordinate with your team to gather, fish, and survive, or risk
  being dragged into the lake one by one.
  .
  Balloon Merchant: A mysterious trader floats in at midday, offering upgrades and
  totems that may be the difference between survival and doom.
  .
  Gone Fishing blends the calm of fishing with the creeping dread of survival
  horror. Feed the lake monster... or become its next feast.
  .
  How To Play
  .
  Gather Bait from the surrounding landscape. Bait lets you catch bigger fish, and
  big fish like big bait. Pressing TAB, or whatever inventory button you've
  chosen, will allow you to equip the bait once caught.
  .
  Go Fishing in the lake. Hold LMB to cast your line. When you get a bite, click
  LMB at the right moment to set the hook.
  .
  If your timing is off, the fish becomes harder to reel in.
  .
  Hold LMB to reel it in, but be careful--too much tension and the line snaps, too
  little and the fish escapes!
  .
  Sacrifice Fish To The Lake Monster by dropping the fish in the altar with 'G' or
  your drop key! Or drop your fish in the Hot Air Balloon Trader's basket to earn
  money for Upgrades and Totems!
  .
  Think you're the best angler in the valley? Prove it.
  .
  Every fish you catch is recorded! Compete with players across the world to land
  the biggest fish and climb the global leaderboard.

developer: Sebastien Bini
publisher: KOMODO
genre: Design & Illustration;Utilities
description:
  Game Character Hub is the ultimate program for creating and editing 2D game
  assets. It provides a built-in generator for character and tileset creation.
  While the program was made to be compatible with RPG Maker XP, VX and VX Ace,
  the elements found in the program should work with other 2D game engines as
  well. RPG Maker assets are for RPG Maker use only.
  .
  Key Features
  .
  With Game Character Hub, you can easily create characters by choosing generator
  parts provided in the program. Simply select a template, add items and you're
  done! You can also create your own custom templates and parts. Note that almost
  the same logic applies to tilesets, so it doesn't necessarily need to be
  characters!
  .
  With Game Character Hub's flexible layering, you can easily customize parts
  according to your needs; such as changing the opacity, renaming, merging and
  deleting parts to name a few.
  .
  Game Character Hub's Preview window lets you see whats going on without having
  to stop what you're doing! You can pause the animation and change different
  settings such as the animation speed, background color and even zoom! You can
  also set custom animation previews with the Animation Management feature. Useful
  if you want to see if your Autotiles or Behaviour poses seamlessly transition to
  one another!
  .
  With Game Character Hub's palette editor, it's easier for you to create your own
  palettes and change values. What's more is that you can generate palette colors
  from all visible layers or specific ones. Great for finding the colors you need!
  .
  Tired of manually merging tile sheets on your own? Game Character Hub has a
  built in tileset merger to save you the work!
  .
  Game Character Hub allows you to easily convert your character assets for
  different RPG Maker engines.
  .
  Other Features Include...
  .
  Flexible GUI Layout - Change the layout of the program to your liking!
  .
  Expansive History Window - Easily undo and redo artwork at any point in time
  during development.

  Sway the odds of platform manufacturers. Games you release influence the fate
  of platform manufacturers for which they're made.
  Good games will make a platform more attractive to gamers and change its
  market share for the better.

  the ability to randomize various aspects of the game at the beginning of a
  playthrough make for greater replayability.
  .
  Full modding support via Steam Workshop. Every little bit about the game can
  be changed with mods, even turned into something else entirely if the

  Welcome to GameGuru Classic, game making for everyone. We've created an easy to
  use and most enjoyable game creator. Join us and our great and enthusiastic
  game-making community on your journey to make fun games! Imagine creating a
  world that you and your friends come together and play... and creating it can be
  a matter of minutes with no technical jiggery-pokery needed at all :-) Of
  course, you can happily spend hours, days..even weeks creating your masterpiece,
  the great thing about GameGuru is, you won't be held up by learning strange
  alien languages or using complex modelling tools. The time you spend with
  GameGuru Classic is all about creating and having fun whilst doing it.
  .
  When you first launch GameGuru Classic, it may appear to be a simple level
  editor, but it's actually crammed with lots of useful tools you will need to
  make your own game, including a character creator, model importer, building
  maker, complete scripting language and of course, over 6GB of complimentary game
  assets to get you started. The fact it's as easy as any in-game level editor is
  a plus, and unlike level editors, you get to save out what you've made and even
  sell your game!
  .
  We've created a small game level for you to play and enjoy, which shows you how
  you might lay out your level, and balance the combat to give the player a
  challenging experience. You can, of course, edit this level any way you wish and
  learn from an existing demo level rather than start completely from scratch. We
  believe there is nothing on the market which enables you to create and share a
  3D game as quickly as GameGuru Classic, thanks to a massive starter collection
  of assets, our easy drag and drop approach and built-in game logic so you don't
  need to code it yourself (unless you want to).
  .
  As a welcome bonus, we have also included an expansion pack with over 2.8 GB of
  additional game assets for you to get started, completely free! In fact, all the
  art you see in the screenshots above are included in GameGuru Classic and you
  are free to include them in your games, no strings attached. We do sell
  additional content DLCs, but with over 6,000 megabytes of game assets already
  crammed into GameGuru Classic, the DLCs are entirely optional.
  .

  GameGuru Classic is not designed to compete with professional development tools

  commercial apps and games. GameGuru Classic is a recreational game maker, not a
  professional tool, and is still very much in development. GameGuru Classic is
  unsuitable for serious game development projects at this time, and we highly
  recommend you visit the forums and ask many questions before you make a decision
  on the game making tool for you.

  A LOVE LETTER TO EARLY SPLINTER CELL GAMES
  .
  You just entered the warehouse through the vent shaft as you hear voices from
  outside. They know you're here. Someone must have tipped them off.
  .
  You continue to stay in the shadows. You shoot out lights, flip off circuit
  breakers and lockpick doors. You are a silent assassin.
  .
  You distract the guards by throwing bottles or imitating their wives voices. One
  by one you pick their lights out.
  .
  Fuck. You've been compromised. You shoot out the next door lock and go in guns-
  blazing. In an adrenaline filled shootout you eliminate your target and barely
  manage to escape. Well done!
  .
  Enter the world of Intravenous as Steve Robbins - a man set out for revenge
  after losing his brother to low-life junkies. Delve deep into the criminal world
  under the guise of darkness or go armed to the teeth, guns-blazing, and padded
  with armor.
  .
  Old-school stealth. Your visibility depends on how well-lit the environment is,
  and every step you take makes noise.
  .
  Teeth-grinding action. Fun stealth gameplay does not exclude fun gunplay.
  Intravenous is meticulously designed to offer stealth for those looking for it,
  as well as no-brakes gunplay to those itching for a gunfight.
  .
  Reactive AI. Your enemies will do more than just rush straight at you. If
  they've found a dead body they will alert their friends in hopes of finding you.
  If they hear you sneaking about, they will investigate. If they see you, they
  will open fire. If they're unarmed, they will try to find their friends and warn
  them of you.
  .
  Capable enemies. Enemies take cover during gunfights, use flashlights in
  darkness, and radio in suspicious activity. Any misstep you make will result in
  your opponents responding appropriately.
  .
  Lots of weapons. Multiple weapons, each with their unique handling. Each works
  best in a specific situation. You're sure to find your personal favorite here.
  .
  Choose your loadout. Pick a rifle, a pistol, and a bulletproof vest to be ready
  for combat, or just a pistol and naught else, to be quick, agile, and silent-
  ready for improvisation.
  .
  Adapt to your surroundings. Shoot lights out, crawl through vent shafts, flip
  circuit breakers off, throw bottles to distract your foes, lockpick doors to
  find alternative ways in - or simply shoot the door lock out, and go in guns-
  blazing.
  .
  A gritty story. Steve Robbins lost the single most important person in his life
  - his brother. With aid from a mysterious person claiming to have suffered a
  similar fate, he decides it's time to take matters into his own hands after the
  police turns up empty-handed. Nothing is as clear cut as it seems to be.
  .
  Uncapped frames per second. 60hz display? Yep. 144hz? No problem. Enjoy the
  swift action or edge-of-the-seat stealth on your preferred monitor refresh rate.

  Marie's journal. When she picks it up, the memories come back. Because twenty
  years ago Kelsey and Marie shared this room. They spent days in it working on

  dirty deal. It's Russian roulette and utterly unfair. The cards I'd been dealt,
  any player would have passed. I chose to be angry instead. But Marie, my friend
  Marie, she got me a new deck. And suggested that I deal again." - Kelsey

  Kindness)? Or do you fatten them up for Human foie gras a Monster delicacy? All

genre: Horror
description:
  No Players Online is a short horror game released on Itch.io, a website for
  indie games. It was created by Belgian university students Adam Pype and
  Ward D'Heer and sound designer Viktor Kraus as part of the Haunted PS1 Jam
  in November 2019. Initially intended to be a twenty-minute horror game,
  the developers continued to expand the game into an alternate reality game
  (ARG) involving cryptic messages and secret passcodes. Players quickly
  solved the ARG on a dedicated Discord server.
  .
  No Players Online received positive reviews from critics, who praised the
  atmosphere, horror, and PS1-reminiscent graphics. Outlets such as Bloody
  Disgusting and The Verge praised the short length of the game and the
  nostalgia it evoked.
  .
  A VHS tape titled "Capture the Flag Project" appears on the player's
  desktop. Clicking on the tape brings up a menu screen similar to an
  MS-DOS, and a selection of empty multiplayer servers. Each server is a
  capture-the-flag game of a first-person shooter (FPS) with PS1-style
  graphics. After capturing the first flag, a record player begins to play,
  and an aggressive, shadowy figure begins to appear throughout the map.
  .
  Before the player can capture the final flag, John, the developer of the
  game, appears in chat, revealing that the game is an attempt to resurrect
  his dead wife, the shadowy figure who is stuck in a state of limbo, and
  that he has been working on the game for eleven years. He pleads with the
  player not to finish the game, as it would shut down the servers and
  destroy his work. The player can either leave the game or finish it,
  after which they will be kicked out. The main game takes around fifteen
  to twenty minutes to complete.

  Version 1.3 introduces the new PvE scenario "The Way of Winter." A new survival
  mechanic, Temperature, makes survival more challenging than ever! Collaborate
  with your friends to build and upgrade the Thermal Tower. Team up now to explore
  the new map, face mighty bosses, secure new deviations, and discover even more
  exciting content!
  .
  The apocalypse changed everything. Human, animal, plant... all are infested by
  an alien creature - Stardust. As a Meta-Human, you can survive the contamination
  and use the power of Stardust. Play alone or join others to fight, build and
  explore. When the world is in chaos, you are our last hope.
  .
  Survive in the wilderness
  .
  You wake up in the middle of nowhere. You'll have to brace yourself for the
  cruelty of nature (from monsters to lack of food); however, Stardust's influence
  does not restrict to living things, it also affects the soil and water. Eating
  polluted food and drinking dirty water will reduce your Sanity. When your Sanity
  drops, your max HP would drop accordingly. To eat or not to eat, it's a
  question.
  .
  Fight against monsters
  .
  Battle numerous enemies that are once human, and challenge bosses from another
  dimension to gain powerful items and ease Stardust pollution. You are not only
  fighting for yourself, but also fighting for the survivors.
  .
  Customize weapons
  .
  With about 100 gun blueprints divided into seven categories for you to collect
  and craft, every loot grants you something new. Did I mention accessories and
  gun perks? Right, they are the heroes here. If our current weapon cannot satisfy
  your need, you can add different parts and perks, upgrade your firearm to your
  heart's content.
  .
  Build territory
  .
  Use Territory Core to build a house of your own. You can keep a practical style,
  jamming everything needed in a small room; or you can design a townhouse with a
  patio, kitchen, garage... The best part is, you can relocate your territory any
  time you want!
  .
  Find out the truth
  .
  Delve into the truth of Stardust, find out where it came from, and what it
  wants. In the journey of seeking truth, you may feel alone, but you are never
  alone. There are several factions in the world, some can be violent and hostile,
  others might be friendly and helpful. Explore human settlements to learn their
  stories or exterminate bosses without leaving a name for survivors to praise,
  the choices are yours.

  New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the
  flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your
  experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked
  by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting
  the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk
  immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character
  you want while exploring Halcyon.
  .
  Lead your companions
  .
  During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of
  characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these
  companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you
  to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
  .
  Explore the corporate colony
  .
  Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate
  board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when
  the terraforming of the colony's two planets didn't exactly go according to
  plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space
  stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.

description:
  PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom.
  Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a
  mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it
  takes to reach the PEAK?
  .
  WORK TOGETHER
  .
  Need a Hand? You'll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the
  mountain, which changes every single day. Help each other up ledges, or place
  ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.
  .
  CLIMB
  .
  The Mountain Takes no Prisoners! Climb through 4 biomes on your way to the PEAK,
  each with their own life-threatening obstacles. You'll need to scavenge for
  questionable food to survive, and manage your injuries carefully - every setback
  limits your stamina, making it harder to climb.
  .
  SURVIVE
  .
  Prepare For the Worst: Discover a variety of helpful survival items, from energy
  drinks to climbing spikes to the mysterious Anti-Rope. You've got no hope of
  making it to the PEAK unless you press every advantage given to you.
  .
  A NEW ISLAND EACH DAY
  .
  The game's map rotates out every 24 hours! Try out the new layout each day, or
  give the same island multiple attempts in a day until you conquer it.
  .
  EARN BADGES
  .
  A Well-Seasoned Scout: Show off your survival prowess with dozens of badges to
  earn and cosmetics to unlock.
  .
  CLIMBING IS BETTER WITH FRIENDS

description:
  Q. What kind of game is this?
  .
  A. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as
  Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.
  .
  Pals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.
  .
  You can even sell them or eat them!
  .
  Survival
  .
  In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger
  waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make
  difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.
  .
  Mounts & Exploration
  .
  Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky--allowing you to traverse
  all kinds of environment as you explore the world.
  .
  Building Structures
  .
  Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are
  no labor laws for Pals.
  .
  Production
  .
  Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine
  ore so that you can live a life of comfort.
  .
  Farming
  .
  Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or
  harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.
  .
  Factories & Automation
  .
  Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal
  in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed--until they're dead, that
  is.
  .
  Dungeon Exploration
  .
  With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the
  time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect
  your life--even if it costs their own.
  .
  Breeding & Genetics
  .
  Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare
  pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!
  .
  Poaching & Crime
  .
  Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to
  get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.
  .
  Multiplayer
  .
  Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together!
  And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.
  .
  In online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.
  .
  Additionally, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together.

  Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City delivers a true third person team based
  shooter experience set within the dark and sinister Resident Evil universe. Not
  only does this setting provide a rich backdrop to the action but it fosters a
  unique and thrilling triple-threat battle scenario for the game modes. Zombies
  and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players compete against
  their team's opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element
  that could only exist in the twisted Resident Evil universe. The result is a
  brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third
  person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated
  Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With
  a cover
  .
  up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all
  evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the
  city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of
  the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon
  S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security
  Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in
  Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill
  set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the
  T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or
  the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo.

  Screencheat is the ridiculous split-screen shooter where everyone is invisible
  so you have to screencheat (Screencheat - verb: to look at your opponents
  screens. Stop screencheating you cheater!). Master a wide variety of one-hit
  kill weapons including a blunderbuss, a car engine that shoots bouncing plasma
  balls and a teddy bear loaded with explosives. Train your skills in the solo
  time trials then engage in fast and frantic combat with up to eight players
  locally on the couch or online. With colourful maps, unique modes and a huge
  number of customisation options including wacky mutators, Screencheat is the
  ultimate party FPS.
  .
  .
  Ten unique and crazy weapons
  .
  .
  Ranging from the dependable Blunderbuss to the heroic Hobby Horse to the
  completely crazy Chefolet (a car engine that fires ricocheting energy balls),
  all are designed to deliver deadly satisfaction. Each weapon comes with its own
  unique advantages and disadvantages, encouraging wildly different play styles.
  These include not only the way a weapon shoots but also the "tells" the weapon
  leaves such as the smoke from the blunderbuss or the trail of fire behind the
  Hobby Horse.
  .
  .
  Nine game modes on or offline
  .
  .
  From traditional favorites such as Deathmatch to the completely unique Murder
  Mystery that challenges you to find and frag your specific target with a
  specific weapon. Play in teams or all against all. Challenge up to seven of your
  mates on the couch or online or a combination of both -- the game is always
  split screen whether you are on or offline. When your friends aren't around,
  test your skills in the solo time trials or play against AI bots.
  .
  .
  Map designed for rapid navigation
  .
  .
  In the spirit of the best arena shooters, youll spend time traversing 11 maps
  via air vents and trampolines until youve acquired your target and fragged them
  accordingly. Each map is designed with color-coded areas as well as plentiful
  landmarks such as statues, paintings, and furniture that allow you to quickly
  locate other players without being able to actually see them.
  .
  .
  Customize and mutate
  .
  .
  Inspired by games like Towerfall, we've provided players with a highly granular
  level of customisation to play the game the way they want to. Choose which
  weapons you'll allow, how and when they can be swapped or reloaded, apply time
  limits, adjust the victory conditions, penalties, and more. To really mix it up,
  add some Mutators such as slow mode, low gravity, or flappy jump.

  times over. You can't let that happen. Don't forget, the fate of the world rests

description:
  Beware the shadows and the darkness which seem silent. Beware the closed doors,
  the whispering mirrors. Beware the Song of Horror that nests in the cracks of
  your mind.
  .
  .
  The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire
  family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for
  him but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that
  will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The
  Presence seems to be responsible and it's still somewhere, out there, lurking in
  the shadows, waiting for you... You may die, but the horror continues others
  will pick the investigation up from where you left it until you all find out the
  origin of The Presence and put an end to this nightmare.
  .
  .
  A PARANORMAL ADVENTURE OF UNPREDICTABLE TERROR
  .
  Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience: its antagonist, the
  supernatural entity known only as The Presence, is controlled by an advanced AI
  (Artificial Intelligence) that adapts to your actions and decisions. Experience
  unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and
  hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player
  and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted
  sequences.
  .
  .
  As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of
  characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different,
  and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to
  approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the
  world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some
  will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can
  die if the Presence gets to them and death is permanent. If they die, you will
  have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so
  their deaths are not in vain.
  .
  .
  SPOOKY CHARACTERISTICS:
  .
  .
  * Investigate a paranormal mystery in a thrilling story of psychological horror
  .
  * Beware The Presence, an otherworldly entity with its own AI that reacts to
  your actions and decisions in a non-scripted, unpredictable horror experience
  .
  * Choose between a group of unique characters: each one brings its own point of
  view and has a different relation to the story and other characters
  .
  * You may die, but the horror continues: death is permanent when a character
  dies, it's gone...but the next one will follow the investigation from where the
  deceased left it. The world will be shaped by their previous actions.
  .
  * Explore haunted, sinister locations to gather clues and items that will help
  you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's

developer: Snake Hill Games
publisher: Snake Hill Games
genre: Animation & Modeling;Design & Illustration
description:
  Sprite Lamp is a tool for combining the styles possible with 2D art, such as
  painted or pixel-art looks, with dynamic lighting found in modern games. Game
  developers will be able to make games in the style of classics like Metal Slug
  or Braid, combined with the gameplay and visual appeal made possible by moving
  or otherwise changing light sources. This is achieved by the artist painting an
  object lit from several directions, images called 'lighting profiles', and then
  processing them into normal maps, depth maps, ambient occlusion maps, and a few
  others. Sprite Lamp also includes a variety of shaders designed to get the most
  out of these maps.
  .
  How it works
  .
  Sprite Lamp is all about letting artists paint images in a form they are
  familiar with, and using those images to create the more difficult or
  counterintuitive maps that are required by modern shaders. This primarily takes
  the form of painting the same subject lit from a few different directions -
  between two and five - and processing these images to create a normal map and a
  depth map.
  .
  Rendering
  .
  Sprite Lamp includes a preview window and various shader options to let you
  experiment and find out what looks best with your artwork. Sprite Lamp's shaders
  are included in Sprite Lamp in GLSL form, fully commented, and can be used as a
  base for including them in your own game. A growing list of Sprite Lamp shaders
  for common game engines is available at . Sprite Lamp's preview window supports:
  .
  Moveable light source with variable colour, intensity, and attenuation
  .
  Hemispheric ambient lighting
  .
  Cel shading
  .
  Self shadowing with depth maps
  .
  Mapping of specular colour, glossiness, emissive colour, and ambient occlusion
  .
  Rendering of animated characters exported from Spine, by Esoteric Software
  .
  Pro version
  .
  Upgrading to the pro version of Sprite Lamp gives the user access to a variety
  of additional features suited to larger studios.
  .
  A full command line interface
  .
  The ability to convert simple-to-paint 'flow' maps to anisotropy maps for use
  with external renderers
  .
  The ability to edit and fine tune the depth maps generated by Sprite Lamp
  .
  The ability to load multiple sets of images, process them all at once, and then
  animate them in the preview window

description:
  Spriter makes it easy for anyone, regardless of experience, to create 2D game
  animations using a technique called Modular Animation.
  .
  Unlike traditional animation which requires each frame to be hand-drawn, Spriter
  animations are made of individual sprite pieces; these pieces can be rotated,
  transformed, and tweened along an animation timeline. This allows you to quickly
  create great looking animations in a fraction of the time while requiring
  significantly less art.
  .
  Spriter also takes advantage of skeletal animation. Create a skeleton using the
  bone tool, attach images to each bone, and finally animate the bones with
  Spriter's vast array of user-friendly animation tools. The result: a fully
  animated sprite using your own graphics.
  .
  Spriter is great for animating characters, user interfaces, power-ups, combat
  animations and more! Even if you've never animated before, Spriter provides you
  with an easy to understand, yet powerful toolset allowing you to jump right in!
  .
  Spriter Pro includes the Essentials versions of all of our Animated Art Packs,
  free to use in any of your game projects. Once you install Spriter Pro It they
  will be located in the following location:
  .
  /SteamApps/common/Spriter/Art Packs/Essentials
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  Using keyframes you can quickly lay out major frame changes. Frames in-between
  the keyframes are then automatically created. You can then edit individual
  frames as desired to make your animations really shine.
  .
  Animations can be exported as spritesheets, animated GIF files, sequential
  images and more.
  .
  Reuse your previous animations by incorporating them in new ones. Create
  perfect, smooth transitions and varieties that save time by working with
  animations you've already created.
  .
  Adjust animation easing with several curve settings to help make your animations
  more lifelike.
  .
  Create pixel perfect retro style animations with Pixel Art Mode.
  .
  Spawn bullets, particle effects, or anything that requires precise locations and
  angles.
  .
  Set up guide lines and load in background images to work on top of.
  .
  Seperate characters into important collision areas.
  .
  Inverse Kinematics.
  .
  Change a bone's parent, add or remove bones, or even change sprite pieces mid-
  animation.
  .
  Import sound effects and even use lip-syncing with built-in Papagayo support.
  .
  Use Animation Data Directly In Your Game:
  .
  Animations are recreated in real-time using the sprite piece images just like in
  Spriter.
  .
  Animations are much smoother and require drastically less memory as compared to
  sprite-sheets.
  .
  Manipulate animations via game events.
  .
  Reuse your animation data for completely new characters or character
  customizations. Perfect for characters who gain new clothing, equipment etc.
  .
  Spriter animations can be imported with full feature support in Unity and
  Construct 2. There are also free, open source, fully featured reference
  implementations for using Spriter files in C#, C++, JavaScript, and MonoGame.
  Spriter support on many more programming languages, frameworks, and game
  authoring tools coming soon!

  You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with
  hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you
  learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home?
  It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life
  have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub
  of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity.
  With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to
  greatness!
  .
  .
  Features:
  .
  .
  * Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm! Raise animals, grow crops, start
  an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to
  create the farm of your dreams.
  .
  .
  * Improve your skills over time. As you make your way from a struggling
  greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming,
  mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking
  and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by
  choosing from a variety of professions.
  .
  .
  * Become part of the local community. With over 30 unique characters living in
  Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has
  their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say
  throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up
  to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their
  secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and
  feast of the winter star.
  .
  .
  * Explore a vast, mysterious cave. As you travel deeper underground, you'll
  encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments,
  valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and
  mysteries to be uncovered.
  .
  .
  * Breathe new life into the valley. Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life
  in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into
  disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old
  community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja
  Corporation.
  .
  .
  * Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. There are 10
  available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character
  progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with
  you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?
  .
  .
  * Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots. The waters are
  teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab
  pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local
  legend!
  .

  * Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum.
  .
  .
  * Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out. With over 100
  cooking and crafting recipes, you'll have a wide variety of items to create.
  Some dishes you cook will even give you temporary boosts to skills, running
  speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like scarecrows, oil makers,
  furnaces, or even the rare and expensive crystalarium.

  .
  * Customize the appearance of your character and house. With hundreds of
  decorative items to choose from, you'll have no trouble creating the home of
  your dreams!

developer: Experience Inc.
publisher: Experience Inc.
genre: Role-Playing;General
description:
  From the dungeon crawling geniuses behind Demon Gaze, this new title takes a
  decidedly more Western approach to the traditional dungeon crawler and infuses
  the game with dark fantasy themes, new gameplay elements, and the ability to
  compete with fellow players through a leaderboard system. At its core it's a
  game about death and fighting against vanishing forever. You will discover new
  meaning in the choices you make to survive against all odds. You will define
  yourself by the lives of those you leave behind, by the people you align
  yourself with, and the experiences you have on each new venture into the dark
  labyrinths that threaten to trap you. Your flight crashes after passing through
  a mysterious portal. As the sole survivor, you awaken to an unfamiliar land lit
  by stars you've never seen. This land is Escario, the city of swords. Quickly
  marked as the Chosen One, the Stranger of Sword City, you must defend this
  place, and choose your allegiances carefully as you scour the land for a way
  home.

  brought to you by a small but dedicated team of developers.

  Imagine a space filled with limitless possibilities.
  .
  Spend your afternoon dogfighting in fighter jets, before winding down in a
  treehouse that exists floating in a nebula. Make a new best friend while
  exploring a haunted mansion, right before playing a hand of cards with a robot,
  alien, and eight-foot tall wolf.
  .
  In VRChat, there are hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of avatars - all
  created by the users. No matter what you're into, there's a space in VRChat for
  you. And if there isn't, we'll give you the tools to make your dream a reality.
  .
  While not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of
  VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your
  movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide
  full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more.
  .
  There's something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what
  you find.
  .
  In VRChat, there's always something to do - and people to meet there.
  .
  Visit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike
  through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with
  some gearheads. Attend a live music event underneath a chemical storage
  facility, and talk obscure genres with DJs. Once you find your crowd, join their
  Group, and you'll be able to find them again the next time you're on.
  .
  Your community - whatever it is - is here.
  .
  There are thousands of games to play in VRChat. Try running a kitchen in a busy
  restaurant, or racing go-karts in zero gravity. Fancy a battle royale? We've got
  those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you've ever
  seen before.
  .
  It doesn't matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing,
  platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to
  play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself).
  .
  Everything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with
  Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power
  as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up.
  .
  But creation isn't just limited to worlds.
  .
  VRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and
  nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you
  can be anything, and explore your identity however you'd like. Want to be an
  alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat
  of music by changing color?
  .
  I mean, sure, if that's what you're about.
  .
  Come on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new
  friends!) are waiting for you.

  You are free to explore the various dream worlds at your own pace.

  If you check certain characters or items in the game you will collect an
  "Effect". These "Effects" can be used to change the main character's appearance.
  .
  Some of these "Effects" have special actions or animations which you can
  activate by pressing 1 or 3 on the number pad.
  .
  Yume Nikki is a very unique title that has become one of the most well-known
  indie games to come out of Japan.
  .
  It is unlike any other RPG, especially in the fact that there really is no
  action or dialogue to speak of. This gives the game a very dark and foreboding
  atmosphere. Can you make it to the secret ending?
