  are found in the different classrooms. Once a player chooses a mission, a

developer: Paintbucket Games
publisher: HandyGames
genre: Adventure;Strategy
description:
  Dark times mean fear and risks. The risk to be caught by patrolling National
  Socialists, looking for people who publicly stand against their point of view.
  The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we're
  opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones.
  This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of
  times.
  .
  You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary
  people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand
  aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime - dropping leaflets
  to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people,
  painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting
  more followers. And all of that while staying undercover - if the regime's
  forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.
  .
  Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing
  on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of
  average people living in the 3rd Reich. Historical accuracy means that your
  small group of resistance fighters will not change the outcome of the war, nor
  will you prevent all of the Nazi's atrocities, but you can certainly do
  everything in your power to save as many lives as you can and oppose the fascist
  system wherever possible.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Experience the Darkest of Times in 4 chapters
  .
  Fight for freedom, weaken the regime and lead your resistance group
  .
  Plan activities, find collaborators and try not to get caught
  .
  Feel the weight of responsibility as you make difficult decisions and face the
  dire consequences
